You won't know why until you have one,"Why do people love their Apple Watches? It's just a watch, for pete's sake! But if you have one you know right away. There's a small miracle that happens in a busy life when you can answer your phone (er, watch?) with your hands full. Or just glancing down to see the text message you just got. Or even completing those freaking rings (don't know? of you will). There's very little bad I can say after having my Series 2 for the last couple of years. I'm happy to get the 3 to have the always-on feature of cellular. I can leave the house and it's not even a problem if I left my phone. Or go for a walk without having a heavy phone in my pocket. It's not even about style, there's just a huge practicality of having a small device attached to your wrist that makes so many problems go away. Here are the positives:• Excellent watch. Like, as a watch.• Receive calls. Make calls.• Receive text messages. Facebook, Twitter, IG, and more.• Interchangeable bands. Fit the look you want, change on a dime.• Siri• Alarms, notes and all the other little apps.• Fitness trackingReally, I don't have any cons. I know people think a smart phone in your back pocket is the top, but this just changes the game. I don't know a single person who ever got an Apple Watch and didn't like it. And the funny thing is you'll never know unless you get one - Because how it changes what you do is the thing that makes it amazing. It's all those small little ways that make for a stupidly brilliant product.Seriously, you, your wife, your boyfriend - It make a perfect gift.",5,1
Love it so far!,I am a Fitbit person. But I decided to slurge a little bit...... The only think that kept me from switching was that I had to charge the watch so much more. I originally had the Fitbit charge 2...... then I purchased the series 3 (42mm) and I love this watch but it was just far too big. So I am returning the 42mm and just received the 38mm and am much happier with the size. I wanted to really share the size difference. I love this watch so far... will review in the future.,5,1
A huge and worthwhile upgrade to a series 1,I love this watch! I upgraded from a series 1. It runs so smooth and flawlessly compared to series 1. It feels like what the Apple Watch was meant to be. The ability for Siri to talk back is refreshing. The ability to see HTML emails is a huge plus as well. And finally the fact that it is waterproof seals the deal.,5,1
Great for those who wear watches and are okay with daily charging,I like the Apple Watch Series 3. After trying it out for a few days I realized a few things: I don't wear watches often enough to justify the cost; You'll likely need to charge it daily; It's great for those who already wear watches everyday and can remember to charge it at night; You'll still use your iPhone to handle most tasks. If you want something only for fitness and/or sleep tracking buy a FitBit.,4,1
WoW!!!,"First off... I don’t write reviews, but WOW! was I impressed with this product. This series 3 watch 42mm GPS came brand new. The box was still seal and the protective plastic on the watch was still on the watch. I bought this for my nephew for his Birthday and was worry that when he opened the box their was going to be things missing I took a risk and I’m glad I did. Thanks to this seller and would definitely buy again. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!",5,1
Definitely recommend,Thought the 42mm was going to be too big with my small wrist. It ended up looking great and got here earlier than expected,5,1
Great upgrade from Series 1,"Upgraded from a Series 1 to this Series 3.I can't believe the difference in speed!That alone made the upgrade absolutely worth it!The move between apps and the messages app are smooth and succinct.The added features that my old watch did not have are intuitive and time-saving: the raise to talk Siri is perfect and works flawlessly.Not having to ""call out"" to Siri is great.The walkie-talkie feature is a tad clumsy, but works well for a quick check-in to/from my wife while I am at work.The kids have enjoyed it too when they miss me during the longer days.While I have not swam with the watch, I have worn it in the shower a handful of times.The water eject button is quite intelligent.I think it simply uses sounds waves to push the water out of the speaker port.You can hear a ""wshhh"" sound, hearing its effectiveness.I will say though, the pitch/volume of the eject noise is quite loud...people WILL look!Like many others, I was hesitating between the new Series 4 and this Series 3.I got it for $229 for Black Friday and simply could not pass up that deal at nearly HALF off a new 4.I don't regret it one bit and am glad I took the plunge!",5,1
Prime with the win,"I ordered this watch this morning and it arrived 6 hours later. It’s brand new still in the official Apple box sealed and came with an extra band(S/M) and the magnetic USB. I must say I am thrilled with the watch, the speed of delivery, and overall awesomeness of Prime!",5,1
My Second Apple Watch,"After getting the initial Apple Watch, I am so excited for the upgrade with the Series 3. After weighing the differences between the Series 3 and Series 4, I decided that this was not only cost effective but completely comparable to the Series 4. The newest model only has marginal differences such as an ECG meter and a slightly brighter screen, but in the era of negligible upgrades there really is no reason not to consider this model over the newer ones. Unless the Series 4 drops in price or even newer, future models has features like a selfie camera, why pay the price? Great for parents and students who want the power of a new Apple Watch without the price burden. Not a lower standard!",5,1
Brand new watch for 50$ lower than retail,I was kinda skeptical at first that this would be a refurbished watch or opened one but when It got delivered it was brand new with all the wrapping around it. The only thing that might be a problem for some would be that it did not come with a charging “brick” for the wall. No problem for me though since ive accumulated a ton. Battery life has lasted 3 days on a full charge so far and Ive used it in workouts and tracks steps gps data and heartrate very well. Havent tried the waterproof feature but I dont plan on wearing it near water anyway since apple doesnt cover water damage in any warranty,5,1
"It's not techy enough, just texts to my wrist mainly.","Ok, I'm not that tech savvy but I thought the watch would do more! I really thought I could use Siri like I use it on my phone, which was a big selling point for me. 8/10 times I use Siri it tells me to continue on my phone. I asked Siri to take me to 'such and such' and it gave me directions with a vibration to the wrist with turns (really close to turning, should give a bit more time to get in the lane lol) which I like. It's good for having your texts at your wrist and that's about it for me. I tried to answer a call on it while my phone was in the other room but the quality was so bad they hung up. It won't set an alarm, only a timer. No Google/internet searching whatsoever (hince no Siri). No scrolling through your social media like FB or Reddit but gives notifications which is annoying. It's kinda like heyyyy pick up your cell and look at this. The battery is good, I haven't charged it in almost 3 days. It tells me to stand up if I'm sitting for an hour. I can ping me cell when I misplace it. That's about all i have used it for. I really didn't need to be closer to my text messages so it's not worth it to me.",3,2
Watched caused huge gash in my 12 year old while swimming!,"My daughter got this for Christmas as she is a competitive swimming and was using the watch to track her swimming.Yesterday, January 9, she called from practice to tell me that the watch had cut open her arm and it was bleeding so badly that the coaches told her she needed to go home.The coaches cleaned up the 6 inch wound inside her upper arm.On close inspection of the watch, although not visible, I noticed a little lip in the beveled part of the glass.When I ran my nail under it it lifted and the glass looked like a razor blade.Checked online and found same complaints on apple website. Parents be advised.Thankfully it was her inner upper arm and not her wrist!",1,2
Already going out for repair; Received 6/23 and going out on 6/27,"I read the positive and negative reviews for this watch before deciding to make the purchase.Things seemed to be overwhelmingly positive that the Series 3 was the way to go for an Apple Watch.As an avid Apple customer and my first Apple Watch, this seemed like a good first way to try this product line.I just hoped, really hoped, that I wouldn't get a watch that was a ""lemon.""I finally decided to buy it when the price dropped to $200.00 - I couldn't wait for it to arrive on 6/23/19.Everything out of the box was fine - totally legitimate packaging, came with a charger, paperwork, etc; no problems pairing with my phone.And then the problems started to happen:-Watch would not ""wake"" with certain wrist movements that I strongly suspected it should have been responding to (these were normal movements) - this is the repair part, so scroll down if this is all you want to read.-Text messages weren't showing up on my screen, although they were coming through; I could only see them by opening the message app.Eventually that resolved itself somehow (nothing was wrong in the settings on the watch or the iPhone Watch app either).-The notification ""red dot"" would not appear on the watch.Eventually that resolved itself somehow (nothing was wrong in the setting on the watch or the iPhone Watch app either).-""Hey Siri"" command, when turned on, only worked about 30% of the time-""Raise to Speak"" feature, when turned on, never worked on my watch and when I raised my wrist to try to speak, the watch face would not wake (and it was supposed to do so)To be clear, even though the Series 3 can get wet and can even be worn for swimming, I had not gotten this watch wet yet or worn it in the shower, so I knew that these issues could not have been caused by moisture.After reading that many other reviewers said that Amazon simply advised them to contact Apple about issues (which didn't surprise me), I called Apple Support.They told me the ""Hey Siri"" and ""Raise to Speak"" feature issues with the Series 3 watch were reported issues and would most likely be patched with the next software update - that was fine; annoying, but fine.I turned those features off.They said the ""waking"" issue was a software issue too.Everything would resolve with an update.They basically said everything would be an update fix.But in fairness, we tried so many troubleshooting fixes - I was on the phone for at least an hour and a half.So, they really did try to help and find the issue.The ""waking"" issue was still bothering me since the device wasn't even a week old and this was my only Apple device that has ever behaved in an unreliable manner.I also own a six year old Macbook Air that still runs completely smoothly.I also have a seven year old iPad 2, a nine year old iPod, and my current cell phone is an iPhone 8 Plus.I don't mean all that in a snobbish way - I say this to illustrate this point:all of my Apple products have been consistent in quality and functionality - I have never doubted whether they would perform the way they should.So I knew that this Apple Watch wasn't right...So I went into my closest Apple store today (6/27/19) so that someone could physically look at my watch and run an official diagnostic.My software was fine, but due to the ""waking"" issue, they told me the watch wasn't right.The tech verified the issue in the store and said that a full unit (the watch itself) replacement needed to be done - remember, I haven't even had this watch a week.Luckily, since I didn't wait to have the watch looked at by Apple, it was still under their official limited warranty.The serial number of the watch was fine - so the product was authentic.Due to the limited warranty still being in effect, the repair didn't cost me anything.The total cost of that repair would have been $229.00.I also bought Apple Care directly from Apple because I read in reviews that people had terrible trouble with their Apple Care codes from Amazon and ""attaching"" it to their account/product...so why not just get it from Apple?So, this huge review is all to say this:I will never buy a major electric device from Amazon again, regardless of how great the price may be.I lucked out with the Apple limited warranty, but I may have been up the creek if it didn't work out or if Amazon had refused to refund my money or send a replacement (which I read that some customers suspected that they may have received used watches as replacements...).I am also lucky because I'm now basically getting an Apple Watch directly from Apple because the repaired units have (I was told by Apple) brand new parts, not refurbished parts.If you think something might be wrong with your watch right out of the box, I urge you to take it to an Apple store so that they can look at it.Although Apple Support is really helpful, no one would have been able to actually figure out my issue if I hadn't gone into a store.As for my faith in Amazon right now, it's definitely gone way down.I'm not sure if I just got a random ""lemon"" from the Apple factory like I feared or if I actually fell into the boat of people who they may have gotten a used watch that got ""prettied back up"" and repackaged when someone sent it back who may have found the same issues I did.I'll never know.But I wanted to pass along my experience.I would say buy at your own risk and hope you get a good one like the majority of people here.",1,2
Adapter,Did not receive the adapter for the charging cable.,4,2
Defective!,"After wasting most of a day with apple tech support, I had to accept the fact that this apple watch was defective. Decided to pay a little more and order directly ftom apple. I had such a difficult time understanding the Amazon representative! Finally, i think, my return authorization was taken care of. Who knows, Indian language reps?",1,2
Paid $283 For An Apple Box Without The Watch,Didn’t Even Recieve An Apple Watch In The Box.Just The Apple Box With The Charger & The Small/Medium Band.,1,2
Everything is important!!!,"Fantastic bit of kit, highly recommend purchasing it. You can monitor calls, txt and emails just by looking at your watch, tell Siri to txt/call someone while driving and people don’t even realize you’re talking through your watch while keeping your hands on the steering wheel!!! Can’t tell you how pleased I am!!",5,2
"Don't Buy from Amamzon; sending defective returns as ""new""","Bought Tuesday, has not worked properly once, lots of trouble shooting. Knew when I received my ""new"" item that it was obviously a return. That is how the world works, I guess, but it was also defective, and that isn't how the world works. Stop doing shady stuff like this, it gives your companies a bad name. Wish I could return it,but I lost part of the band, so I am stuck with a nothing more than a kids toy.",1,2
Excelente,Genial! El contenido tanto la calidad del reloj es excelente. En principio había comprado uno que nunca llegó pero Amazon me hizo la devolución y pude comprarlo nuevamente. Recomendado al 100%. Excelente compra,5,2
"Will not take a charge, and is now dead.*Update below*","*Update within parenthesis....(Took watch over to Apple Store, and thankfully it isn't the watch, but the charger, so beware if you have this issue. Not really sure now all pieces of this set is in fact new?)My daughter opened this yesterday. Let her wear it for a while before placing it on the charger. Did not charge at all. By the time I figured this out,I tried turning it on and off/hard resets, and then finally the update it needed through the app. It was too low on battery to complete the update. If that was the issue, it’s a moot point now. It’s a mini paper weight. Dead and unable to charge. I am getting my own watch in a couple days...so hoping my charger will work and that the actual watch for my daughter isn’t a goner. Very disappointing considering it’s a brand new item.",1,2
This apple watch serie 3 is awesome,"I can use many words to define this apple watch serie 3, but it definitely can not be just one word, I can begin by saying that it is sophisticated, beautiful, luxurious, of great quality and very versatile ... I think I could say many other words about how good it is but I believe that I would extend a lot. I love this watch because it is super cool, you can read your messages just with turning your arm and looking down, answering calls, using GPS and a lot of things more. another thing that I like very much is the size is not too big andit is not very small.and it is very versatile due you can interchangeable bands so I can combine it with the color of your clothes or cap. the only thing that I do not like, and that is why I do not give the 5 stars, it is because after so many years apple continue with a square watch design, I would like them to take out a round model, however this does not take away the excellent that this watch is.<U+2705><U+2705> If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below !!!",4,3
Stuck in loading :(,The watch was in a constant state of pooping the Apple logo and did not break out of it even with a reset.,1,3
Treat Yourself,"I bought the Apple Watch for fitness tracking. It is THE thing at my gym. I went from a Fitbit to this and wow! I think the tracking is way more accurate.I’ve been one of those that rolled my eyes at this watch because who really needs this right? I’ve been pleasantly surprised at how much I love this and how have I lived without it? Everything cane brand new in the box - watch, band, charger. I did not like the band so have purchased another. The battery life isn’t great. I find myself having to charge every day or every other day. With my Fitbit, it was maybe once a week. But we all know Apple + batteries does not equal great things. So...go ahead and treat yourself! Order yourself one!",5,3
"Once you go Apple, you'll never go back","As the owner of a Series 2 Apple watch forjust over 3 years, I had intended to upgrade to the new Series 4 watch until I saw Amazon's sale of the Series 3 watches.It was too good to pass up.I can't see much of a change in functionality from the Series 2, so no learning curve is required.After three years, the battery on my series 2 was approaching the end of it's life which required a recharge during the day to make it past 5:00pm.I expect at least three years of battery life out of this Series 3 before needing to upgrade again.My Series 2 watch put every other watch I own on the shelf, and I have no intentions of ever wearing them again.This watch does everything, even the things I didn't know I needed before.The main feature I wished was better is battery life.You only get about 18 hours out of a new, fully charged Apple Watch, so it needs to go on the charger every night.My biggest recommendation is to also purchase a screen protector.(Can't stress this enough, so BUY ONE!)That is very cheap insurance to prevent a very expensive repair if you're outside of the Apple Care window.I think I had to pay $200 to replace the display on my Series 2 watch, so consider yourself warned.",5,3
Love It!,"I wasn't sure if I wanted an Apple watch because I was not sure of the usage I would get from it. However, since purchasing it, I have been extremely happy with it. It is nice to be able to not have my phone on me (if I am within Bluetooth range which is a small range, but doable if you leave your phone in your purse and have to walk around an office). I am able to check and respond to texts, Messenger messages, and emails, and there are multiple features which allow you to silence the phone or put it on Do Not Disturb (just like the iPhone). Most of all, however, I love that the watch tracks my activity. I am not a fitness buff and I did not really have an interest in tracking my heart rate and steps throughout the day, however, it is fun to look at the statistics and set goals. I also like the, ""Breathe,"" feature which coaches you through a minute of breathing--it helps you cool down and forces you to take a short break from life.Long story short: I thought I would regret purchasing this and that it would be a waste of money, but I am extremely happy that I did. I utilize it more than I thought I would and I love all of the features on it.",5,3
Wish I would've stayed with Fitbit,"This has got to be my biggest disappointment with Apple.I have two iPads, a MacBook Pro, been using iPhones for over 6 years.So it's not that I hate Apple, but this ... was a complete disappointment.Glass screen is uber fragile, battery life is horrible, and the fitness components SO LIMITED!It's good with notifications and being able to respond, but my cellphone is always with me.So I feel this was just a useless investment as it does not track my sleep natively nor is its fitness app anywhere close to Fitbit's.Glad I didn't pay the premium ""new released product"" price, but I'd much rather have had a Fitbit Versa - even with their limited notifications.",1,3
Apple Watch always Excited,First Apple Watch for my spouse as a Wedding Gift. She is excited and speechless... Will go with additional strap to add a sporty look.,5,3
I don’t think it’s new,It seems to be running great.They described it as new.. but it has a year + of someone’s workout on it.,3,3

amazing,"i never thought i would get an apple watch, but wanting to add some tracking/encouragement to working out, i went for it. i also swim, so that was a big seller for me. i am SO happy with this watch. simple to use and works great. charge always last me at least a full day, if not 2. i got a Velcro strap for it, but the one it comes with is fine and comfortable. the tracking is accurate, and the swimming tracking is insane. it tracks each specific strokes (free, back, ect) distance you go for the workout which i am so happy with. love the product and highly recommend. for being a generation behind, it is still incredible.",5,3
Great while it lasted...,"I got my Apple Watch delivered with same day shipping on March 1st. I paid $219. Thought I was getting a pretty sweet deal on an older generation non cellular Apple Watch. Comes boxed up looks perfect. Works great up until around mid May. Touchscreen starts acting wonky. I can’t do anything. Can’t select stuff on the screen, can’t use a passcode. It’s hit or miss 80% of the time. I reset and unpair several times trying in vain to get my little watch to work. I give up and chat with Amazon, who politely tell me I have to contact Apple. No problem I do that. I chat with Apple. They tell me they will send out packaging to send the faulty watch back so it can be either repaired or replaced. I send it back and get and shiny new replacement. Now I have some suspicions about the first one I received. When you have the settings set to the Apple Watch unlocking when your phone unlocks as long as you are wearing it that’s a handy feature. Never worked with the first one. I had a little bumper guard that came with a band. Itdidn’t fit on the first one. Slid on perfectly on the replacement. Was my first one some sort of counterfeit?I think these heavily reduced 3’s on Amazonare very much buyer beware. If I get a 4 or the next gen after that. I will be buying directly from Apple.I gave 2 stars because don’t waste your coin buying it from here.1 star because you have to download a sleep app5 because the Watch app is okay3 for the battery life, cause it ain’t no Fitbit Charge. Lol.",2,4
Amazing X-Mas Gift at an Amazing Price!,"This is a awesome gift at 225$ and prime shipped on black friday, in sealed box, with full 1 year warranty by apple. i'm very glad with my order. this is the Series 3 and has several updates from my previous series 1, love the waterproof design for this! it keeps me up to date with my notifications and more, without needed to take my phone out of my pocket every time it rings!",5,4
Defective!,My husband bought me this watch as an anniversary present. I tried to pair the device to my iPhone for days... I reached out to Apple support online and they can not figure out the problem. I have a meeting with an Apple technician in person and if they still cannot figure out why THIS BRAND NEW WATCH will not pair... I am returning and better receive a new product that ACTUALLY works. I have been wanting an Apple Watch for years... my husband and I are so disappointment that this gift has been such a headache!!!,1,4
Is everything at Apple fragile? Cost to repair greater than the cost of the watch !!!!,"I can count on one wrist the number of watches that I have cracked the watch face on, just one. Apple knows how to build a phone and peripherals are their forte because my MBP laptop and my phone have bags of accessories. They suffer though from building a watch that is not really a watch. I do hear stories of these watches surviving submerssion for weeks at a time and being discovered in the surf still intact and working. I've had this particular watch for six weeks. I travel but I'm not bouncing the watch around and dropping it. I just happened to look down and the damn thing is cracked. Did I bump against something? I couldn't tell you. All I can say is all my ""classic"" watches have never cracked. Tag Heuer, Rolex, Timex, Fitbit, none of them have ever cracked under more strenuous conditions - Apple? What can I say, all roads point to a lack of Jobs oversight but I believe that might be too simplistic. The durability isn't there and the cost to repair is greater than the cost of the watch itself. So caveat emptor or maybe cave tempus, vigilator - just know what you're getting into when you buy this watch.",1,4
Highly Recommend!!!,"I bought this watch on Black Friday and got THE BEST DEAL! No other store or websitehad the watch priced lower! It was brand new and I was still able to add Apple Care+ after my purchase! Love this watch! I didn’t want to pay a monthly service fee for it because really, I’malways going to have my phone on me. I’m still able to use it to make phone calls, text, check email, get my social media updates and lots more! When I’m at home or at the office, I can still move between rooms (without my phone) without Losing service! So glad I didn’t waste money on buying a watch with a cellular plan!",5,4
Overall Great,"The watch for me overall is good! It came in an actual Apple box with all original apple parts. So as many people have mentioned in their reviews, the charging cord IS included but the little box that you plug the cord into and then plug into the outlet, is NOT included. For me this wasn't an issue considering I have plenty of spares and the 2 lamps in my room both have usb ports for the charging cord. I had no problem with setup. Both band sizes (S/M and M/L) were included. Some have said they have an issue with battery life. I have not yet experienced that. I worse mine for 2 days straight (excluding when I showered) and the battery was still at 40% when i finally charged it. I tend to sleep through alarms on my phone in the morning so I make it a point to wear the watch to bed. I charge the watch while I shower or while I'm sitting at my desk doing homework for school so my watch rarely drops below 60% battery. I've had to update it twice in the short 3 weeks that I have had it, but that an apple issue not an amazon issue. I had no problems with updating as some others have. I haven't tested the water resistance yet as I just don't quite trust it. Everything has always said that electronics and water just don't mix so until I get a waterproof case on it I'll just stick to what I know. I've seen a lot of reviews that say they essentially only use it to get texts when their phone is in another room, but I will say that I actually using the replying and calling features on the watch. Naturally the call volume and quality isn't the best but considering it's a WATCH that's not an issue so it's not worth all the other complaints on it. Working in a childcare facility, I can't have my phone on me at work. But living in Oklahoma during storm season, I like to be able to get updates from my weather app letting me know what's going on in case of inclement weather. Overall I have no issues. Especially considering the steal on the price!",5,4
Get one now!,"Ok. I had recently purchased a Fitbit Versa, and was very happy with it, except for the fact that I could see my texts or incoming calls, but I could not respond to or answer them. Then I had a few friends tell me how much they love their Apple Watches. Then I saw this price. $199! I probably wouldn’t have purchased it if I hadn’t had a stash of unused Amazon gift cards, but I am so happy I did. I love this watch! Really. It has so many features. I love that I can track my steps easily. The workout functions are super easy. Also, with 3 kids and my hands always full, it’s easy to respond to a call or text from my watch. Honestly, I didn’t realize how much i’d Use this feature. The flashlight is bright, I can ping my phone (because i’m always setting it down and forgetting where), I can even take pictures with it. I also prefer this shape and profile to the Versa. I most definitely recommend this watch!!",5,4
If I could give this product 6 Stars I would,"I never write reviews on products... ever!! but this is the most satisfied I've even been with a product that I've purchased online. I order the 38mm white Apple watch and it was so perfect, even came sealed in a brand new apple watch box. It came with two different sets of wrist bands as well as a charger. Definitely worth the money. Would recommend to anyone skeptical.",5,4
Iwatch was locked and I can not use it.,Product was activation locked. It is not useable.,1,4
This is trash— do not buy from Amazon!,"Update: I took the replacement to Apple. They said it looks like these are such old watches they’re sending out that the only way to update the firmware is to send them back to the Apple warehouse. So if you’re willing to do that, the watch will maybe work? I’m just returning this and buying a new/working one from Apple...I ordered a watch. It came, it wouldn’t pair (like a lot of reviews I’m seeing). I talked to 5 different Apple representatives over the course of 2 days; their conclusion was I got a dud and should ask for a replacement. The new one came. It still won’t pair. It goes through the normal steps and then pops up saying it cannot pair. Apple doesn’t know what’s going on. Maybe it’s still attached to someone else’s Apple ID like a lot of people are saying? It’s not worth the money you save to buy it from Amazon. Don’t believe the 5-star reviews, this watch is useless.",1,4
Slow and overpriced even at new low prices,"I am very underwhelmed with my first Apple Watch.Coming from a Fitbit Alta HR, my first impressions are that the battery life is much worse, it doesn't track your sleep and doesn't have alarms (that I've been able to find) to wake you up. It also requires daily charging and the only charging cable is too cumbersome to carry around.While I will be keeping it because the find my iPhone button comes in handy and the reminders to practice deep breathing are nice, I wish I had held out for a newer version of the watch.",3,5
It arrived earlier than what was first promised.,It connected and started up right away. No issues. love the look and feel. I didn't realize they send an extra band that is a bigger size. That was nice because I need the larger size band so I changed to it.,5,5
"Very Disappointing, Just buy from Apple!!","As tempting as it may be to save a little money, just buy the watch from apple. I ended up paying $200 for a watch band and no watch. While amazon has accepted a return, it has not been as smooth a process as it should be, and the last amazon representative I interacted with was incredibly rude! Save yourself the headache, read the negative reviews before purchasing, I am not the first person this happened to and a number of other people received defective items!! I ended up purchasing the same watch from apple, paid a little more, but at least I got the watch and it works!!!",1,5
Watch is awsome,So when I ordered this I order the white band and silver case but I got the black and gray one.... other then that this watch is amazing!! I love it!,4,5
Great watch but FRAGILE! (And too expensive to fix),"Great watch but sadly not very durable. All the features are up to par with Apple products but the screen is extremely susceptible to cracking even with the slightest bump. Had it for a month before a small bump against a wall created a crack across the face horizontally; the touch screen does not function at all now. Apple repair is $289, which is more than the cost of the watch! Highly recommend getting a protective case for this due to the poor screen durability.",2,5
Intuitive Handling,"In the few days that I’ve had this it’s been very easy to learn on how to use the watch. The battery life is around as advertised, being approximately 18 hours, however I have not let it fall under 30%.The settings for notifications can be made to be grand, or very subtle. Being a student, having only the vibration that isn’t audible is very nice, especially if in a quiet setting.Sleep tracking can be odd for the watch as it hasn’t recognized me sleeping, however it could be that I move excessively during sleep or my heart rate doesn’t drop as low.I did however buy AppleCare+, after buying it here, from Apple directly.Overall very satisfied, will update in the future if complications arise.",5,5
Watch too fragile for ordinary wear and tear.Apple charges $159 for repair of known fault.,"I bought this series 3 Apple watch on prime day in July 2019 for around $180. It worked fine and I especially like the heart rate and activity function. In mid-September I woke-up in the middle of the night with the face dangling from the watch. The face had a crack along the edge of the watch. I do not recall any particular incident with the watch like dropping it, slamming into something etc. I took it the Apple store and they told me they have had a problem with the face cracking on this model and there was a free repair as long as they didn’t determine it was caused by and accident. There was no Indication on the process they used to determine whether it was caused by an accident.I asked what was the cost to repair if they determined it was caused by an accident. They told me it would cost $159 to repair. I knew that I would never pay $159 to repair a watch I paid $180 for and that couldn’t hold up to normal wear and tear. So that is what happened, they wouldn’t repair for free and wanted $159 to fix it. So I now have a piece of junk. I truly do not recall any incident where I banged this watch so be wary of this fragile piece of electronics. I would never buy another one. Too much money( even with the prime deal) to have something that can’t stand up to normal wear.",1,5
I wouldn't have paid more,"I have wanted the Apple watch since its first debut.It was the thing to have the be all end all for watches.So when I caught the cool special at $120 I snatched at the chance.I am not really sure what I expected the watch to do toward enhancing my life. Does it look cool? Yes.Does it keep me constantly in the know? Yes.Does it have every gidget (i.e. app that is on my phone)? Yes.Would I have perished had I never gotten the Apple watch? No.Like my Iphone I don't use every app and because my job requires me to be on the phone and computer all day - let's just say I could do with always have constant contact with the world.It's a nice gadget.I like the look and interchangability.But the battery does seem to wear quickly and of course there is the perfect band you need to findand the protective face cover so you don't damage your investment.All in all, I would probably buy the Apple Watch 3 again at the same price.Butwhat do I know, I am still using my trusty Iphone 7.Too much in touch is sometimes - too much.",4,5
Super awesome watch (first time smart watch owner),"I’m only on my second day of using this watch so I hope I’m not posting a great review too soon but I LOVE this watch! It’s my first ever smart watch of any kind. I decided to get 3 series because I didn’t want to spend $500 on the 5 just to find out I didn’t like it, but after this one, I’m sure I would!I have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of learning the functions. I got the 33 mm because I don’t usually wear watches and I didn’t want something huge. It’s the perfect size and I’m so glad I didn’t go bigger!The texting is easier than I thought it would be.Siri and voice commands are super easy to use.Battery life depends on use but seems to be pretty good.Touch is very responsive.Volume is perfect.Pairing with my phone was a flawless process.I have no complaints so far! Worth the money especially if you only want to pay a fraction of the cost of the latest model for a watch that is great!",5,5
LOVE IT!,"It’s exactly as described!Brand new and box was sealed!Best price!It’s replacing my Fitbit Versa.There is no comparison even though Fitbit has been wonderful to me.Nothing beats Apples display, size, functionality, etc.",5,5
Works Great,Battery Life is not the best. Last me around 12-16 hours per day. Besides that everything works great!,5,6
"Battery charger sucks, apps impossible to figure out","Received in a timely manner, apple care data was sent through email, was no problem as it gave agreement number and hardware serial number. HOWEVER, this thing eats the battery. I dimmed it, removed a bunch of stuff that ran in the back ground, battery still does not hold charge even for 24 hours. And to make matters worse (or maybe this is the worse part), the charger is absolutely a piece of junk. Took 6 hours to charge from 40% to 100%. I discovered I had to lay the charger completely flat and the watch on top. Anything less than that, the watch slides to the side a minuscule amount without being noticed and does not charge. I cannot charge at night I want the sleep data. Cannot charge for 6 hours in the day, I am fairly active. If the charger was designed to hold the phone in place instead of just stick with a magnet, I am sure the charger would be fine. And if you go to the apps screen, WOW, forget it. I have numerous logos which I cannot access since I have fat fingers and picking a single logo is not going to happen. Besides, I do not know what every logo means. PLUS: phone rang while I was outside and I answered it on the watch. That is a real PLUS. Sound quality not the best (come on, this is a watch), only one person had trouble hearing me but I was outside and it was a little windy.",1,6
The watch is perfect,The watch is perfect. It came two days later ALTHOUGH I paid for next day shipping!! I’m also missing the adapter that was suppose to be included.,4,6
I'm happy with it but it's far from perfect,"I bought this watch as a replacement for my 5 years old garmin Vivoactive. Overall, I am happy with the upgrade, but not everything is better. Here's my pro/cons list:Pros:* Tight integration with iPhone. I love getting alerts, email, messages,etc. in a way that I can interact with them. On the Garmin, I would get the notifications but I could not read them (the font was too small) and the interaction was much worse.* I love being able to answer a call from the watch, this is an amazing feature and works very well.* I like how it looks. I bought a metal band and it looks great.* I like having a heart rate monitor, my Garmin was an older model and did not have this functionalityCons:* I hate having to charge it every night. My Garmin lasted a full week and the Samsung lasts about 3-4 days* It's a lot heavier than the Garmin* I am extremely disappointed that Apple has chosen to keep the watch faces locked. On the Garmin, there were tons of cool watch faces to choose from, and the Samsung has some that are way cooler than anything the Apple watch hasOverall I like the Apple Watch and I'm happy with it. I was able to get it for about $200, which is a pretty darn good deal. I don't think I would even consider paying the amount Apple wants for the new one.",5,6
Un buen producto por un precio justificado,Bastante sencillo para usar y muy buena la aplicación.,5,6
Doesn’t Work!,What a disappointment this watch is. I spent over 5 hours trying to get this watch setup and paired with my phone and all I got was a “pairing failed” message even after trying every suggested fix. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with tech support and they couldn’t figure out the problem. Now I have to wait to go to the Apple store (which is nowhere near me) and have them try to solve the problem. I should have just gone and purchased a watch from the store in the first place instead of on here. Terrible quality control! Apple/Amazon can’t even sell a working Apple Watch. What a joke and waste of my time and money!,1,6
Def not worth the price,"I’ve had this for several months now. I explored in depth what was available for it to see what would deliver the most value for me. Sadly, it isn’t much.I “upgraded” from a Samsung gearfit 2 which was falling apart. It had been a couple years and it was time for something new. I quickly found that just because something is more expensive doesn’t mean it’s better.I like the overall construction and solid feel. The battery life is good enough for me to only charge it every other day. The band is pretty unique and fits comfortably. Thats about it.I really don’t like the firmware. The watch is trying to do too much all while failing at being a fitbit. I paid extra for a larger screen and still struggle hitting the tiny app icons. They display in a honeycomb array and there are far too many of them. Most of which you can’t remove because apple says so. You can display them as a list but again there’s so many it’s tedious to navigate. When do find the one you want it takes way too long to load. On the gearfit it was builtin. You swipe left and input water intake, swipe again and input caffeine, etc.. It’s quick. Track whatever you’re tracking and move on. The rest is automatic. For the Apple Watch you need to download water/caffeine/step tracking apps that either cost extra or are free and clunky. Once finally setup you need to wake the watch, enter your passcode, navigate to the honeycomb, find the app, wait for it to load, and then input your data. Each step takes a few more milliseconds than it feels like it should for $330 device.During workouts it pauses randomly for no reason. Disabling auto-pause doesn’t correct it. If you wear it inverted you’ll have to tap it to wake it up each time and then enter your passcode to resume which is such a distraction/waste of time I disabled it as well. This then means Apple Pay won’t work. I’m ok with the insecurities of not having the passcode though. If someone steals it they’d be inheriting my bad investment and freeing me up to buy something different.",2,6
The best there is for iPhone users,"I had the original Apple Watch and loved it, but recognized some of the shortcomings.It wasn't waterproof, the battery life was poor, it was slow to respond, and it didn't have GPS.After a year or so with the original, I sold it and went watch-less for a couple years.I was ready for a new fitness tracker, so I did hours of research.Eventually I landed on a Garmin smartwatch.While it had its strengths, the UI and display killed the experience for me.I decided to return it and go back to Apple, trying out the Watch 3.If you are all-in on Apple products, there is no comparison to the Apple Watch.Unless you are really hardcore into a niche fitness activity, the fitness tracking features of the Apple Watch will be more than enough for your needs.The GPS is accurate and provides a detailed map after the activity is complete.Since the original Apple Watch, Apple has added monthly challenges for fitness.I really like these and it helps me stay mindful of my activities.The integration with App Store apps is amazing.I use Insight Timer daily for meditation, Spotify during workouts, the excellent Carrot Weather complication, and Uber when traveling.All in all, a seamless and pleasant experience.Battery life is greatly improved from the original watch.I can put the watch on at 6am, workout with GPS for 30-45 minutes, and still have 60% battery life when I go to bed.If you are questioning getting an Apple Watch...don't!It's one of Apple's best products and can literally change your life.",5,6
It works great and it's only $199!,"I was super excited to get the product in the mail. The price was the biggest selling point for me. I have always wanted an Apple watch but, the price was a big problem for me. So, when I saw it on Amazon for $199, I was sold. Most of the reviews were positive, and I never had a problem before with Amazon when ordering Apple products (even certified refurbished items too). The watch even came before the estimated delivery date!The Apple watch came in a tightly sealed box (as do most of Apple's products do). The box contained everything a standard new Apple Watch comes with: the S/M and M/L wrist bands, the charging dock, all the paperwork, and most importantly, the watch itself. Everything was brand new and in impeccable condition. The watch came nearly with a complete charge and started up with no issues. The setup was easy and the watch synced to my apps automatically. I was able to pair with my phone and adjust the settings to my preferences. The watch's response is seamless, and it's fluid when switching between the watch and iPhone.I think the watch is worth the money if you're using it to trach your health and for hands-free purposes. It's great if you're always on the go and busy with work that you don't get much of a chance to check your phone. Also, if you're phone is stuck in your bag or if it's on silent, the watch is a great way to get those important notifications instantly. And if you're a commuter like me, it's a life-saver.",5,6
"HOW IS THIS A CERTIFIED, REFURBISHED PRODUCT?!?","I am very disappointed and frankly pissed. I purchased this watch for my daughter to be able to have and USE before she starts back to school. The watch arrived yesterday morning. After unboxing, of course we immediately tried to set it up by synching it to her iPhone. After attempting this multiple times on her phone with no success, i decided to try and sync the watch to my own iPhone. Still would not pair. So i called amazon support who then transferred me to apple support. After being transferred to multiple different people and being on the phone for two hours with representatives who were trying everything to help me sync this watch to either of our phones, they determined that there must be an internal hardware or software glitch with the watch and that, unfortunately, there’s nothing else that we could try to get it to work. GREAT!! So now we’re here, stuck with a watch that was supposed to be “certified/refurbished” that does NOT work and now my daughter will not have it in time before school.",1,6
Stick with the Apple Watch Series 3 for Now,"I had a Series 1 Apple Watch for 4 1/2 years.It finally died.I think moisture did it in.I was researching the newer models, mainly the Series 3 vs. Series 5.I opted for the Series 3, mainly because it was $199.99 for the 42mm version ($169.99 for the 38mm version), versus $414.99 for the Series 5 44mm version ($384.99 for the 40mm version).The Series 3 has a better battery life.It is water resistant to 50m; same as the Series 5.That was especially important to me, and a big improvement over the Series 1.Sure, the Series 5 has extra bells and whistles like EKG monitoring capabilities.But unless you are a cardiac patient, you don't need that.The other bell/whistle with the Series 5 is a fall alert to a third party.Again, I don't need that right now.The Series 5 also has the 44mm screen size if desired, which is a plus.Probably the biggest advantage of the Series 5 over all previous models is the always on display.Honestly, for an extra $200 for a Series 5, it isn't worth it to me.I have gotten used to tasing my wrist to see the display, and that function actually preserves battery life.In addition, the Series 6 is likely coming out in the fall, so if you're gonna shell out the ""big bucks"", I would wait 2 or so months.I would also expect the Series 5 to be discounted once the Series 6 comes out as well.Whatever you Series you decide on, I STRONGLY recommend you get a reliable screen protector.I bought a great one on Amazon for $10.99.I am very happy with my new Apple Watch Series 3!",5,7
Great watch,"I am a watch wearer and this has replaced all of my watches. I haven't used the full functionality of the watch but I primarily use it to workout. It tracks my workout progress and calories better than the workout apps I used. I haven't showered in it so I'm not sure how well it holds up in water but I do swear a lot when I workout and I've never noticed a difference in the way it functions. It is hard to use when your fingers are wet but that would be the case with any touch screen device. I don't often use the speaker on the watch itself when I'm talking on the phone but when I do, the people on the other end hear me clearly and I hear them clearly. Paring my phone and airpods to the watch was a simple and easy step.",5,7
Producto incompleto,"El articulo llego incompleto, los componentes de la caja no son los que se describen.",1,7
I'm in LOVE,"I should'vebought this a long time ago !! I love all the features it has and I've only used in one day.I couldn't be happier with this watch and all the features. I have a 7 inch wrist, amfemale and the 42 mm screen is perfect for me, definitely not too big or bulky. The alarm is great for me. I'm a nurse and set it so I can remember all sorts of things, such as when to start an IV, give a pain med, or when I'm home when to put clothes in the dryer. You can even snooze the alarm. Messages come right to it , as well.I have it set for 24 / military time, which is helpful, too.",5,7
One of those wearables in which you don't need until you own one,"I had a gift certificate to apple and was gifted a watch series 4. I had gotten as far as pairing it before I thought how redundant.This time around on amazon prime day, got this for a reasonable deal ($170~) and paired it. Same thoughts, uh-oh. But then I told myself I need to be objective and fair and give it a week.I use this watch for 1) strava without my phone in my pocket what a great feeling 2) as a remote for volume and skipping ads when listening to podcasts 3) a reminder for standing and breathing and well being 4) to send brief one button text replies to simple texts from family and friends.The fact that's it is all silicone allows me to wear it out style or sport and not worry about it too much. Ion-X glass is similar to iphone screens so it's pretty good, not as solid as a sapphire on my automatics (that's the ultimate for wearables).Well, now I have to sell about $18,000 in watches because the iwatch just made all my automatics useless.",5,7
Heart rate tracker helped alert me! <U+2764><U+FE0F>,I love the fitness and heart rate tracker on my watch. Able to track exercise throughout the day and steps at work. I had a crazy health issue the other day and my heart rate was all over the place. My watch gave me an alert that my heart rate had a huge jump of 30 points. I actually ended up being quite sick and ended up being hospitalized the next day with tachycardia symptoms due to septic shock. My watch in fact picked this up when it started happening.,5,7
"Updated, Heart good. Mapping apps not ready for backcountry use.","I bought this Apple Watch 3 to do two things: measure my heart rate during workouts and help with maps on my wrist while hiking and dual sport motorcycle riding. It does the heart rate measurements OK but took work to get the settings right so that it wouldn't switch out to other apps while I needed to see the heart rate. Heart rate measurements are noisy and intermittent.The mapping apps are at best only poor for backcountry use. I need to import gpx tracks and see those on the watch. Not working yet.Frequently, I can't reach down and fiddle with buttons and knobs. I need to set it up once with a map display that has what I need in it and leave it there for sometime. Like a half hour. I've tried several apps including Gaia, topo, topo plus, viewranger, etc. They all are simply not ready for prime time yet on the watch.The weather app works intuitively well, so have updated the review from 2 to 3 stars.Very tempting to return the watch back to Amazon where I received it from a week ago. But I hate returning stuff.I will hang in trying to get this watch to do what I need and update this review if successful.Update January 12, 2020. I've owned this watch about a month now and I'm starting to get to know it better. It still hasn't supported very useful mapping in that I haven't found an app yet that will allow gpx tracks to be displayed on the watch. This was really one of the two main reasons for buying the watch so four stars might be generous.However the heart rate measurements are actually very good. Graphs are shown and, while occasionally there are wildly incorrect heart rates shown, those are relatively few. The heart monitoring app supplied by Apple does a good job of keeping track of workout heart rates vs resting rates, etc. It is quite good and I know a lot more about mine then I used to know. I'm 61 years old and have a resting rate of 49 and a peak workout rate of 160. I've actually discussed the 160 with my Dr to understand if I was in any danger. No problem but don't go any higher was the answer. So this was made possible by this watch.Also, there are other apps like weather and messaging that are very nice. Hence the four stars.",4,7
Series 3 became more affordable,"Once the series 4 came out, and with the holiday deals, I’m happy to have received the new pricing and opportunity to get the series 3 watch.I’ve never really liked any type of digital watch, since analog hands were just more desirable to me. . This gadget is more useful than any watch ever. Finally, tech to be happy to wear, and swapping the face is a great feature.",5,7
Tiny wrist friendly!,I have super tiny wrists and this fit better than the ones I tried on in store! Very pleased with this purchase.,5,7
DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON,"I am ready to get rid of this watch. I’m having many problems with this Apple Watch. Recommend purchasing from Apple store direction and not amazon. The warranty and return period passed and immediately after it started glitching. Amazon said they could do nothing about it and provided zero support. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON. Took it to Apple store for support and it was fixed for a day, now I am having same error. Apple warranty and return period is much longer.",1,7
Saved from a poopy diaper,"I was looking for a replacement for my old Fitbit (the profile was too big and was getting caught on my baby’s clothes) and was contemplating going with the Fitbit watch because there were a lot of features on the Apple Watch that I didn’t think I’d ever use - texting or calling from my wrist was one of those features. Well, I received it and easily set it up. Within the hour of swapping out my old Fitbit for the watch, my newborn daughter had a poopy diaper which I went to change. Before I could get the new diaper on, she continued to poop right on the changing table, followed by some water fountain-esque pee. After grabbing both legs AND arms to keep them contained, I found myself in a pickle as her dad was out in the front yard and couldn’t hear me even if I yelled. APPLE WATCH TO THE RESCUE! I was able to call him and ask for help while maintaining a firm Hogtie hold on our daughter (My phone wasn’t even in the same room at the time).Since then, I must say that the watch has come in very handy on several occasions. As a first time parent, I didn’t realize how often you may need a third hand or how inconvenient a phone is to hold and use with a squirmy tiny human.This should be on your baby registry if you don’t already have one.",5,8
Best value health/fitness watch,"I have had my Apple Watch Series 3 42mm for several weeks now and I am enjoying it thoroughly.The built-in Apple Apps are excellent.I really enjoy the daily health goals it sets and provides info on and it has been invaluable in gathering data for a recreational mountain bike race I am training for.The builtin gps without cellular or the phone with you works very well.I have compared it to results from a bicycle mounted odometer.The apple fitness app has tons of activities available for tracking.I have use cycling, hiking, walking, and running so far.The screen is exceptionally sharp and bright.I was very pleasantly surprised by the battery life.I have taken it to travel for two long weekends without the charger.At night I put it into battery saving mode and was able to get through the whole weekend on a single charge.I have had a couple of fitness trackers.For the price of $229 at purchase, this is by far the best value I have gotten so far.Most other fitness trackers with gps cost significantly more than this and other people have shown that this performs nearly as well as products that cost 2-3 times as much.",5,8
Defective,"Was really excited to buy this item. Worked great for about two weeks, then started malfunctioning. The touch screen stopped working, was not able to click on any apps. The screen would turn off a second after turning on. Very frustrating. I took it to the Apple store, the employee said he had not seen a watch malfunction like that before. Luckily Amazon accepted my return, which I am appreciative of - however, I hope they do not resell this watch as ""new"" to another customer.",1,8
Love this watch!!!,"I have been wanting one for a while and purchased it right before it went on sale (boo hoo) but I am enjoying it every much. I bought it for the health and activity features but love the fact I can read and respond to a text message on it, get weather updates and control my music. I wanted the newer one with the blood pressure monitoring but that will have to wait for now. Great entry level Apple Watch. If you're on the fence about spending the money on a watch, go ahead and try this one out. I think you will be very pleased with it.",5,8
So far...love it!,"I got the smallest size in the series 3.Very happy.All the apps I want to use on my watch are available.Pandora, My Net Diary, Pokemon, Heart rate app.Love the walkie talkie feature.Thinking of getting the larger one for my husband for fathers day.I chose not to get the cellular service because I really don't mind having my phone with me, but I love not having to take my phone out when I am on a run.I only wish the charge lasted longer that a day.Previously had a fit bit, 4-5 day charge, but I could not see the face when it was sunny out.Definitely sticking with apple.",5,8
Battery life is disappointing,I took advantage of prime day and bought the Apple Watch for $200. I thought I would love it but it didn’t grow on me at all. Prior to having an Apple watch I had a Fitbit and liked the simplicity of it. The Apple Watch had a variety of apps on it but a lot of them I never used on my iPhone so never used them on the Apple Watch. The most disappointing thing about the Apple Watch is the battery life. Every day I had to charge it which was extremely inconvenient. I ended up selling the watch and switching back to Fitbit.,3,8
Defective- Slow and Wouldn't charge,"My watch arrived very quickly. My husband heard a thunk and then the doorbell rang. Sounded like the delivery guy threw the package to our door. Inside of the oversized box was just the watch. No padding or anything. I was so excited to use it. I opened it up and synched it to my phone everything worked well except it was very slow turning on. I went to charge it and it didn’t work. I tried multiple outlets, charging blocks, and angles. Nothing. It would keep connecting and disconnecting it seemed. I messaged Amazon to try to get a new charger. Amazon was awesome and connected me to Apple. Apple went through diagnostic tests and after 15 mins, told me I needed to take it in. I was annoyed because I JUST got this watch and already there were problems. I was just going to return it but I really did like the watch.Edit: I ended up taking it to Apple at Best Buy because I was in the area. Within 2 minutes, the guy said, Yeah, this is defective. I would return it ASAP.” For the heck of it, I looked at Best Buy’s price which was $80 more. I told the employee my troubles and he was able to match Amazon’s price. I bought it right on the spot and it works great!I’m a little bummed that the one from Amazon didn’t work right. I was hoping to earn points on my Amazon credit card for the purchase. Oh well. At least Amazon was great about returning it.",2,8
Love this watch!,"Super easy to sync up and customize.Came charged so I was able to set it up immediately and begin using it in minutes.It came with a Large wrist band attached, but it also comes with an extra band for small/medium wrists.Love the magnetic charger which makes it really easy to take off and charge on my bedside table when it needs it.So far, I've been going a day and a half or so without having to charge, I also like that it reminds you when the battery is low.The various skins/customizations of the face of the watch make it super user friendly and easy to make your own.I'm happy with the purchase, and glad I didn't opt for a newer generation when this one has everything I need and at a much lower price point of $200.",5,8
Defective,"Apple watches come defective, got a 2nd one as a replacement and issue still is happening. I called Apple tech support and they weren’t able to figure out the issue and suggest to just get a replacement again. Very disappointed that after all the trouble shooting we still couldn’t make it work.",1,8
Buyer beware!!!!,"Do not buy this !! I cannot tell you how much time I wasted trying to get this to pair up with my iphoneX. What should have taken a few minutes to set up ended up being hrs of frustration, getting Apple support, then having to run the watch all the way to an Apple store only to be told it needed to be sent out to have the software updated! It wasn’t able to connect to any iPhone at all. Apple said that’s what happens when you buy from Amazon? Just an epic 3 days of total frustration and wasted time. I wish I had never bought the watch!!!! 0 stars on this. I’m really disappointed with Amazon",1,8
"I don’t see the hype, too many issues","I’m not 100% satisfied with the Apple Watch. Only because I’m not a big watch person in the first place, but I have to use one at my job(medical professional). This gen 3 is annoying how the screen turns on every time I move my wrist, and coincidentally when I actually need to see the time and turn my wrist towards me the screen doesn’t turn on....come on. Texting on the watch is a nightmare, the pad to scribble your letters is a pain to use, it always reads my letters wrong. Another annoying problem is multiple relies to a text, if I want to send more than one reply to a text as it comes in on my watch, I have to exit to Main menu and go to my texts to find the text I need. Overall, I don’t see the hype.",3,9
It's $50 less on Amazon...cool!,"It's a brand new Series 3 Apple Watch being sold for $50 less than on the Apple site and arrived same day on a holiday (vs. 2 business days from Apple)...so I'm pretty thrilled with those variances. As far as the product goes...it's an Apple Watch. It isn't a necessity but it does link intuitively with an iPhone and serves as a decent fitness tracker. I have had a Series 1 for 3.5 years and it still works great. This Series 3 was a purchase for my wife and there are some improvements, but the only reason I'd replace a perfectly functioning Series 1 with the Series 3 is if I did serious swimming or wanted to wear while surfing. In short, if you don't already have an Apple Watch and you are on the fence - buy this one.",5,9
Can't Live Without My iWatch,"My first iWatch was a series one and this purchase was made after not wearing a watch for almost 20 years.When the series 3 went on sale, I was like, ""booyah!"" and grabbed it. I chose to purchase the 38mm because that's what my series 1 was so I could keep using the same watch bands, which numbered around 18 or so (all purchased from Amazon).I can honestly say that I use with ""watch"" less as a watch (I occasionally check to see what the time is), but more as a timer for work and home, tracking my steps and importantly, tracking my heart rate. My doctor had taken me off a medicine and I found that my heart rate had gone up. I remembered that the watch tracked my heart rate ad I was able to show the doc how much my heart rate had increased and when. Just that made the iWatch totally worth the money.If you've been on the fence about getting an iWatch, think of it more as an extension of your iPhone than just a watch. It's pricey, but totally worth every penny I paid for it.",5,9
"Was iffy to try this, its pretty decent but ....","Okay, I am an apple freak but I NEVERwear a watch. I've been debating about trying one seeing that a majority of my clients have them on and love them. I saw it on sale and figured I would try it. I have to say I do really like it but the battery doesn't last more than 24 hours (which isn't horrible, try to charge it while you are sitting for a while), the sleepwatch app works the best of all that I tried and is easy to use, it is really nice not to have my phone out all the time and still see what's going on. I LOVE the driving maps on it, especially living in hands free MN, I love talking on my phone if I need my hands and it is pretty comfortable to wear. I also like the heart rate monitor. What I don't love, I sit for my job and yet I reach my standing goals every day...um, sitting. That is a little frustrating but hey, its not like the watch can sense how far I am off the ground. Not sure how accurate it is overall, but it gives me something to go off.",5,9
Eeehhhh!!,Compared to the Fitbit versa 2 this is a bust!Pros:1. Changeable bands(very cute options)2. Changeable watch facesCons:1. Battery life( last half a day and I don’t use it for a phone or music just a watch)2. Very bulky and I bump into everything when I’m wearing it(my clumsy fault)3. Takes forever to charge (runs out of battery in no time)4.disconnects from the app by itself!5.takes forever to turn it back on after it’s been sitting on the logo screen for 10-15 minute usually!I wouldn’t buy it unless you buy the newer one might be faster and work better!,3,9
"Just break down and get it, you won’t regret it.","I am so glad I purchased this!!!! I’ll admit I was a little skeptical just as others were saying because of the description stating it was an Amazon renewed product. I honestly expected it to come in a brown box, plastic wrap all over the watch from being refurbished, etc. - and I also honestly thought people posting pictures of the item coming in new packaging just got lucky lol BUT mine came in all brand new packaging, sealed up and never opened before. If it is a refurbished product they did a bang up job of mocking the real satisfactory feeling of opening Apple packaging lol. Aside from it arriving in perfect condition, it also arrived a day early. I’m so in love, people are right. You don’t even know until you have one. Then on top of the early delivery, flawless new packaging and perfect condition, the watch itself works like a champ. I honestly had a hard time deciphering between the different features of series 1, 2, and 3 but what I do know is this thing has everything you need. It’s water resistant up to a certain level but regular swim sport and play is A Ok with it - just no scuba diving and high impact stuff like water skiing. Read and reply to text messages. Receive, make, and answer calls. If you use apple wallet get ready for a game changer lol plus a lot of the apps you use will have Apple Watch apps to go with it, so you have a ton of things to play around with. It’s true, battery life only lasts one to two days if you’re using it regularly like me, but that doesn’t bother me. I don’t wear it to track my sleep so it charges every night for me. All in all, this thing rocks and I’m so happy I finally broke down and made the purchase.",5,9
I'm impressed but the battery life and the price are little to be desired,"This is an awesome product, no doubt. Being able to access Siri, the weather, send/receive messages, make calls, and access many of my apps with the flick of a wrist is amazing. I tried a knock off because I didn't want to pay the price for the few things I wanted the watch for. This watch is a lifesaver at work. I love not missing notifications for meeting reminders and communications with my team.I am only giving this three stars because the battery life is pretty poor. I know the watch is performing so many functions and requires a lot of juice. I have adjusted the settings on the app so I can squeeze out three days before I have to charge. I do wish there was a quicker way to put the watch in sleep mode when you just want it to be a watch. It does this but it takes a bit to get into the settings to do it. This would be one step closer to saving battery life. Also, one of the ratings said sleep tracker- I haven't found this yet on my watch so I rated this as a 1-star. I didn't get it for this purpose but will now spend some time looking for it.I didn't get this watch as a health tracker but am interested as I get older to see what I can learn about myself so I'll see if this watch helps with that. It does help me with my busy work and grad school schedule right now, which I am very grateful for.Now, if I they can just add a solar charger so it charges itself throughout the day! Come on Apple, I am counting on you.",3,9
Never thought I’d own one but I love it,"My job doesn’t allow cell phones at work, that being said I can read and respond to texts very quickly and no one knows. It also sends me alerts about my fitness,I found it annoying and furnished but it surprisingly motivates me to put in that extra 10 minutes to meet my fitness goal",5,9
Works perfectly but buy another wrist band,"I love this Apple Watch. I personally have not tried the sleeping tracking but one of my coworkers had got an Apple Watch after I told her about them and she said that it works perfectly. You can count your steps, message, call, play games, use the GPS and probably many other things that I just haven’t found out about. But the thing I most like about the watch is that you can put a passcode on it and when you take it off it locks. Because while I was grocery shopping the bangLoosen while I was carrying my cousin to the car and dropped and I didn’t noticed til I looked at my wrist by this time the watch was gone and I started tracking it and found that someone turned it in to the cashier thank God I put a passcode on it or it probably would not have been returned. But I would recommend buying another wrist band because the worst band it comes with will loosen easily and slip off without you noticing til the last minute.",5,9
I love it and I can’t say that enough!!,"Don’t know why I didn’t get this earlier. I had been buying all these other brands of smart watches and they ended up breaking and then I’ll buy another one and then another one. Wasted money away and then finally decided to spend a little more to buy Apple Watch. I have been missing out a whole lot. This is the watch I should have bought years ago. It has everything I need and more. It’s the smart of the smartest of the sports watches. Tracking my activity and everything else is here. If you haven’t bought one yet, you’re really missing out.The only thingI don’t really like is the battery life is poor. I have to charge it every day. Hey but I don’t mind doing that.",4,9
a very nice weatch 38 mm white band,"I just bought this old version apple watch 3, instead of more expensive apple watch 5 because my main purpose is to monitor my heart rates, while waiting for a future model that can measure both heart rates and blood pressure. it costs $169 and I used installation payment of 6 months. What can you expect? it seems almost costing nothing! But I have found it is a super nice watch, like other apple products, high quality, beautiful and also having many functions! (I might like many people, did not think such a watch had much use), I was totally wrong! I can use it in many ways including listening to audio books! A very nice feature is that I set up Earth as the watch surface, so I can see our beautiful planet all the time and see it rotates with sunlight covering my location. From the watch surface Ican also check the weather of my city instantly (after set as the default location). I am very amazed by this product.",5,10
Buy it!!,The real. I love this watch. The battery is t the greatest. You’re not going to be able to sleep track unless you charge it before sleeping. I typically charge my watch every evening to have enough charge for the next day. I opted to not get a cellular version because who really doesn’t have their phone near them most of the time? I have always said I’d never buy it but it was worth every penny! It also comes with two bands so I wouldn’t worry about sizing. You can also compete with your friends in fitness games.,5,10
Disappointing on two major counts,"I've had this product for ten months and used it regularly for fitness monitoring and various other applications.The battery charges fairly quickly, but with frequent or continuous pairing with my iPhone, lasts less than two days.That means I have to put it on the charger every night or run out of charge the following day.This takes away from it's usefulness as a sleep monitor.You can't do both.It's either on the charger or on your arm.Even more disappointing than the battery issue is the ease with which the watch face can be scratched.I don't do anything out of the ordinary in terms of exposing the watch face to abrasives, yet it looks like I've had the watch for ten years!Scratches everywhere.Bottom line.Over-priced and poorly fabricated.It will be my first, and last, iWatch.",3,10
Would not pair! Seems like a common issue.,"This would not pair to any of our iPhones. I spent hours trying to get it to work. Amazon technical service transferred me to Apple support. They couldn’t get it to work either. They scheduled me an appointment at the Apple store which is a half hour from my house. They couldn’t get it to pair either. It is now being sent off to Apple and I have to wait. After having these issues, I read a lot of reviews with the same problem. The software is the watch hasn’t been updated and it can’t be updated without pairing it an iPhone. UPDATE: I received my watch back from Apple repair and it works great! They updated the software. I love the watch, but would recommend buying it from somewhere else until this issue is resolved with the batch on amazon.",1,10
Excelente,"Fue en regalo de cumpleaños de mi novia y le encanto, tuve varios problemas con este articulo y mi banco pero ya esas son cosas que se salen de las manos del vendedor.",5,10

Apple products seem to never disappoint. I wish the battery life was a tad longer but no biggie considering it charges super fast!! My box came with the watch, a charger, and 2 different size wrist pieces for the watch just incase your wrist is bigger or smaller. I was definitely surprised with how amazing this product is overall.. I used to have a cheaper “Fitbit” type watch but it wasn’t accurate with the information. I confirmed how accurate the heart rate monitoring was by checking it myself while comparing to what the Apple Watch says. If you are thinking about purchasing this then just BUY IT NOW. For only $199 it’s a steal. I definitely won’t go back to using my old watch. I would recommend getting a Clear, rubber type “casing” screen protector for it just so it doesn’t get scratched or ruined from everyday wear.",5,10
Genuine product,"I can verify that this is a brand new-straight out of the box Apple Watch! I have been consistently wearing it for roughly two weeks now and I love it! I have had no issues with it, it came in pristine conditions, the battery life is as decent as I expected it to be, and it performs all of the functions that I need it for. I will warn, I need to charge mine about once every 2-3 days, which is a bit more than my previous smart watch, but since I use the Apple Watch more throughout the day I’m not too upset about this. I would definitely recommend, especially when the watch goes on sale. It’s a great buy and it is a genuine product!",5,10
USP adaptor,"I just received my watch and I'm happy with it.I see the website says it includes a power adapter however it seems that Apple perhaps stopped including them?The box is too flat for one to fit.That being said, I called Amazon and an agent agreed to send me one at no charge.Amazon sells them for $15 so if you don't receive it, give them a call.I suggested that they change the listing if in fact none of them include adapters.The price is great (even without the adapter).This is an upgrade from a Series 1 and it seems faster and the screen is brighter.",5,10
Money well-spent!,"Came exactly as ordered. This one is an upgrade from my gen 1 series watch, but I didn’t feel like shelling out close to ~$800+ for the new gen 4.The battery life isn’t as bad as I’ve read in previous reviews. At the end of the day, I’ve had from 50-60 percent battery life, and that’s with moderate to heavy usage. You still have to charge it every night, but I personally don’t consider that much of an issue.I’ve already persuaded my sister into buying one and will definitely continue recommending to friends and family.",5,10
Why did I wait so long!,"For the past several months, since working at home, been using my commute time to workout instead. My stationary bike has a heart monitor but was sometimes off, so I decided to get a wearable (I had a very simple activity tracker). Thought about (and read about ) an activity tracker (Fitbit, others) but decided to look at the watches instead. Did a lot of reading of reviews, and for my purposes/needs, decided on the Apple 3. Since arriving, I have been wearing daily and love it!. Battery time is about a day (which is what I expected). It connected easily with my iPhone. I'm using it for tracking activity; there's an exercise icon that you can set for a specific activity (indoor or outdoor walk, cycling, running, yoga, elliptical etc). The activity icon is a great motivator (love seeing the circles close)! I bought a screen protector and extra bands-to change it up (easy to change, push the button and band slides in/out). Love my watch!",5,10
Hot diggity dog what a watch!,"What a watch! I hope you have TIME to read this review bc you’re gonna WATCH the story of me and my watch unfold.I always liked the idea of an Apple Watch, but I used to not like it wear watches at all. I thought it was a waste of space on my arm and honestly a lot of people look kinda nerdy with them on. Plus, why would I wear a watch when I have my phone w me always? Or I can just ask tbh. But idk man, something in me changed and I started casually looking at watches at stores more and really taking notice watches on people. I then saw SharkWatches and I was like omg nuuuuut I gotta have one. It’s sporty and I fw it ya know. So I got one on the 50th Anniversary of Shark Week and it’s got sharks all over it it’s pretty dope ngl. Soon I became dependent on it and felt naked without it on. I was a watch person now and there was no looking back. So I realized I could get an Apple Watch bc I’ll actually use it now. I asked my momma for Christmas for one and spoiler alert, I received this bad boy. SooooooooooIf you’re looking for a watch to brag to all your friends about, look no further! These bad boys are one step below air pods on the bragging scale. Do shut on your watch in front of your friends to assert your superiority. Go crazy with it! Just go insane !Anyway I really like the watch it’s a great product. I wear it everyday and learned everything about it so I could use all it’s dope azz features. I recommend",5,11
"Review of Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS, 38mm) - Space Gray Aluminium Case with Black Sport Band","We have become an Apple product house (2 iPhones, 4 iPods, 2 iPads) and have loved these products.With my wife running, it made logical sense to purchase the Apple Watch Series 3 as it would offer seamless integration with her iPhone.The box is typical Apple. Simple, functional and everything is put in place perfectly. The phone came with some charge so it was ready to be used (did require a proper charger thereafter). Setting it up on Apple Watch app was easy, and she was ready to use it within minutes.It is light on her arm, doesn't cause excessive sweat when not being used during exercise, and is unobtrusive when being worn.I see the price has dropped a bit too, and it's worth picking up on the Series 4 if you can.",5,11
Amazon CS Is the worst,"What a nightmare. Purchased for new fitness challenge and it came already attached to an Apple ID. Got the run around from amazon for 40 minutes and treated like garbage. Finally told them to pay the difference for the new one or unsubscribe me from prime and I’d go to Best Buy. They agreed to pay the difference for the new watch. Idk who failed at amazon, checking on Apple IDs but they need fired. Started my challenge with no tracker, days behind others now.",1,11
Highly recommend,"People say you don’t know why everyone loves their Apple Watch til you have one and boy are they right! I tried several other smart watches that had lots of problems before trying Apple. Wish I had just gotten one of these in the first place. Watch came new, sealed in the box. Works perfectly with no problems at all. I use my watch constantly all day at work and only charge it every other night! Other watches I tried barely made it to the end of 1 day. Love this watch!",5,11
I. LOVE. THIS. WATCH.,"Why did I wait so long to purchase an Apple Watch???? This beats fit bit hands down, so many cool features. Most importantly, you can actually see the clock face when you are outside!!! That used to bug the crap out of me. what good is a watch that I couldn't read half the time.I love that I can wear it in the pool, answer my phone in the pool, and control music while in the pool.Its a cool looking watch too, and the band is real comfortable material. It doesn't come undone either.I am so glad I finally bought an Apple Watch. I am done with Fitbit.",5,11
"Great product, glad I went a few models back.",A really cool 'device' because it does so much more than just a watch. I typically am a regular watch kind of guy but bought this for the activity feature. At first i wore it everyday over my regular watches and loved the features. Charges easily and looks very sleek. Connects seamlessly to the phone and others when permitted.I still have the standard strap on it as i like the simplicity of it but in true Apple fashion the abundance of accessoriesavailable make it very easy to customize. I went with the 38mm because i didnt want to risk something too large on my wrist and because of the small difference in price. Still undecided on whether the small additional cost would have been worth it but overall happy with the purchase.I'm glad i bought the 'older' model because i just dont think i could have justified the price for the more current ones.,5,11
Ok. Battery life not great. Kind of just for fitness motivation,This watch is undoubtedly a great tool for different purposes based on personal schedule / lifestyle. Love the features but really my main concern is always tracking my steps and activity and having that motivate me and battery life. This does a great job as long as you keep it charged. I have noticed the battery life out of box is very unimpressive. I have heard that from many. I also wish Apple had the same charging port as the phone etc. as an option but understand that would cause issues with waterproofing tech. It’s ok. Unless you’re a huge Apple person or need the features of texts/ Apple exclusive features I may opt for a better bargain watch of another brand. It is lightweight and I will keep but I would never pay more than I did for one of these. They simply are a bit overpriced for what they are. SURPRISE. Welcome to the world of Apple. Will keep,3,11
Get this watch!,"I’ve always been a Fitbit user and I’ve owned many models over the years, including the Ionic and the Versa. I really haven’t been impressed as of late, so when I saw this on sale for $199, I jumped at the chance. Now that I’ve been wearing it for a few weeks, I will never go back to Fitibit! I’m obsessed! I love all of the customizations and integrations with my new iPhone. I was a bit hesitant to purchase the 3 and not the 4, but I’m so glad I did. I’m pleased with the speed and the battery life (lasts about a couple days for me.) Also, as a fitness professional, I love that, although it does track your steps, this watch focuses more on calories burned and movement. I’m sure I haven’t even scratched the surface of what this incredible watch can do. So glad I made the switch!",5,11
Won’t connect issue fixed,Well after an hour of trying to get it to connect to my phone and failed time after time I called apple support and 3 hours later I find out the watch won’t update due to the watch having such an old version on software.Update they have pushed a software patch though love the product I just wish it would have worked right away when I took it out of the box,5,11
Very happy with this purchase!,"This watch is amazing! I bought one because my parents always seem to call me when i’m driving and I needed a hands free way to answer and still be able to keep my eyes on the road. The watch came with two band sizes and a charging chord. I absolutely love it and am so glad I bought it. I got the smaller size and I was concerned it would be too small due to me being a plus size person, but it’s perfect! I love this watch and i’m so happy I finally bit the bullet and got one. It’s one of those things I wasn’t sure would really make a difference, but it’s helped me in so many areas. It shows me reminders, messages, calls, any notifications I get, I can pay with it, Keep track of activity and exercise, etc. It’s amazing! It came with everything I needed and the battery life is super long! At the end of a full day of use mine is still at 30%. So happy with this purchase!",5,11
Don’t expect to buy a new watch!,"I’m the type of person to do my homework on making expensive purchases. I looked at all the sites that sold Apple watches Every major store had roughly the same price for a series 3. So I decided to purchase through this seller due to the price being slightly cheaper. I was under the impression that this watch would be new due to the fact there was no text stating it was refurbished. When the watch arrived I noticed that the Apple box was not wrapped in plastic and the box was scratched up which was a red flag there. Then the watch band had some sort of orange markings on a white band. The face of watch had noticeable scratches and a small chip as well. I thought I would try to pair the watch with my phone and was unable to because the watch was still linked to someone else’s email. So the watch was completely useless to me. I understand that this is an older model, but if you are going to sell a refurbished watch you need to state it in the description. Also you NEED to make sure the watch isn’t paired with another persons email before selling to a customer. The watch could have been stolen for all I know. Watch was retuned and I ended up buying a watch from the Apple Store.",1,12
Going back to Garmin! Apple Watch generated hairline crack in first 30 days. NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY,"Going back to Garmin Smartwatch products! Long time Apple customer with many MacBooks, Mac Minis, iMacs, iPads, iPhones, etc at my business and home over the years. First (and LAST) Apple Watch based on my first 30 day experience.The Apple Watch 3 screen generated a hairline crack on day 30 of ownership. Bottom of screen is now non-responsive to touch, so watch can no longer be unlocked. Watch was not dropped at any point. Apple support had me send in to the Apple repair center after a week of back and forth between local Apple warranty provider, Amazon support, and Apple support. I believe crack is due to manufacturer defect, but Apple repair center does not agree. Apple repair center quoted a $229 repair, which is same price as new watch! The same Apple Watch 3 normally costs $229 new.Even if I had purchased AppleCare+ ($49), Apple insists I would have had to pay the Accidental Damage repair fee ($69). Since I have contacted Apple about problems with this Watch, the watch is NO LONGER eligible for AppleCare+ coverage. Total out of pocket $118 ($49+$69) is certainly less than $229, but I believe this type of defect should NOT incur the $69 repair fee either.I've been a long-time fan of the Garmin HR watches for running and cycling. I've experienced several trouble-free warranty claims with Garmin over the years and I would have expected SAME or BETTER warranty support from Apple. I hope Apple considers changing their warranty repair policies for anyone else who may experience a similar situation.",1,12
Great series for the simple things,"If you are more into the applications of the watch instead of just something to receive messages/calls on then this review won't be much help but if you are looking for the simple things then please do read on!I personally just wanted an apple watch to get notifications of messages/calls so I wouldn't have to carry my Max size phone everywhere with me and especially at work if its important I can see the message. This watch so far as not disappointed! I do not like small screens (reason for me having a max size phone instead of regular) so I do not really care for all the extra features on the watch besides notifications and of course telling time (:Battery has been great, has lasted a lot longer than my phone that's for sure. I do charge it every night but by the time I get done with the day the battery is at like 60% before I even put it on the charger. The S/M band was great size for me!There are some misleading reviews about what comes with the watch. In my box I received the watch automatically attached to the S/M band but it also came with a M/L band in case it was needed. I also got the charger for the watch.I received the 38mm face size which is a great size for me because I do not like big and bulky but I am sure i would have been happy with the bigger size just didn't want to spend the extra money. I also ordered a pair of the silicone screen protectors to put on (2 protectors for $8).You set up your watch through the app on your phone which is very convenient cause I can't imagine setting it up on that little screen. Great watch and I am so happy I finally got one even if its the series 3 a lot of people say that it is just as good as the new models and cheaper (:",5,12
Actually like this watch,"Interesting watch. Not as much detail as the fitbit but it does have a customizable screen so you can see what you want on the screen instead of having to only use the phone.Like the fact that I can answer calls with the watch, which is good when I happen to step away from the phone while it's charging and can still see the call. Just wish the battery life could be longer, but given what it does and how much it can be customized withe the different complications, I can see why it's a short charge hold.",4,12
Best steal ever !,"Man I remember when these were $529 , this is an amazing deal it works amazingly and watched many yt videos that recommended this one instead of the upgrade, very easy set up. Make sure to update your phone to speed up process (:Mine is the 38 mm in Space gray aluminum, although I ordered a pink sand band for $5 separately! Also and extra band comes inside in case the size you git ended up not fitting as well as a charger without cube !",5,12
Great birthday gift for my wife.,"Bought this for my wife's birthday, she loved it. Works great out of the box. easy pairing with IOS. (Look up how to get the exact notifications you want to show on the watch) after a bit of tinkering it's great, many features you aren't looking but turn up being helpful.Some of the features my wife really likes:- Siri on your wrist.- Only the notifications you want, good for meetings.- Hands free calls, good for quick calls.- Speech recognition for replying messages quickly without getting the phone out.- Gps for running workouts.- Spotify quick controls.- Looks great.",5,12
Watch volume. Not so much.,"Volume on watch was to low to use on phone. Talking person on other end said was scratchy and couldn’t understand me.Used phone for everything. I seen on youtube two way conversations were clear and loud. This on i have tried everything to hear it was not to happen. Will try one more time today. I got it for phone and gps while driving and textIng when not near phone. . Just as easy to use phoneIf volume wont be loud enough to hear. Will go back. Could just be this watch. Many for sale refurbished or renewed As they say.Wanted one for so long. Not just now. Can’t 5 star it cause it’s not working for mine. I seen it work fine on 1 and 2. For speaker volume. seen it work on youtubealso make sure you want it. went thru hell on return, cant do return thro your orders, it makes you call cust service to reset watch. and they will generate ther eturn, its easier to drop it off a ups store, can return it that way. save all return info,, you'll need it..",2,12
Worth maybe $50,"Pros:-You can tell the time (its a watch.)-You can (sorta) text-Games?? technically-tracks your steps and heartrateCons:-Other than telling the time and tracking your steps, heart rate, and sleep, there is not much this thing can do-You have to either scribble out your texts or use speech dictation. scribbling is good for one word replies but thats mostly it-Apps on this thing barely have any functionality. For instance, on the robinhood app, you can only view your portfolio’s value and the price of your stocks. You cannot see or do anything other than that. no trading. no viewing trends. nothing.-The games on this app suck. they use either the touchscreen for simple up down left or right movements, and the watch dial.-Probably the most undeniable downsideis that you have to charge it every night. so whats the point of the sleep tracking feature?!dont waste your money. buy a regular watch and something nice for yourself with the money you couldve spent on this",1,12
The most confusing apple product ive ever bought,"I bought this watch so i could track my miles, listen to audible books snd podcasts and so far i havent figured out how to do any of that. This is the most un-user friendly apple product ive ever purchased. It comes with zero instructions so im googling you tube, tech support calls to audible and apple and im still extremely frustrated. All i want is to easily transfer info from my phone watch spp to the watch. Errors, trying this and that mostly unsuccessfully. If i cant download audible books im sending it back. Steve Jobs is missed!!",3,12
Love my Apple Watch,"I’d put off buying an Apple Watch because of the price but after having gone through several other trackers, I decided to gift myself with the one I really wanted and I’m so glad I did!! Changing watch faces is simple (I’m currently in love with the Minnie Mouse face because when I tap it she announces the time and if it’s the 1st time that morning she follows the time with “good morning!” which makes me smile). The activity tracking is good and I enjoy the reminders to stand up and to breathe. Great purchase no regrets.",5,12
"Excellent battery life, comfortable to wear, fantastic and accurate tracking of exercise","LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!I use to have a Fitbit Charge 2 HR. Even though it said it would automatically track exercise, it didn't. It took forever to connect to my phone. It didn't do a great job of tracking the exercise even when I did manually start it. I would be at the soccer field running and it would say that I had gone up 20 flights of stairs. Plus, the battery life just wouldn't last. Just not accurate at all. That is not the case with this Apple Watch. It is really accurate. Automatically tracks exercise. Its lightweight and comfortable to wear. I usually forget that I have it on.Easy to learn how to use and definitely worth the money (although its not that expensive).I wear it everyday all day and the battery is still at 65% at the end of the day. Its a beautiful watch. Looks great when working out but also looks professional for work. I highly recommend this product.",5,13
Too FRAGILE!!!,"I wanted to love this watch, and for several months I mostly did:the swim tracking app was not perfect, but not bad; the walking, running, exercising all seemed fine; I liked the look and got almost 3 days from a charge (non GPS model). But then I tapped it against a doorframe - careless, but not a heavy blow.Cracked the crown and its a goner.Apple won't repair it and I'm out ofluck.I didn't have Apple Care - if I did a new one would only been only $70; as it was, I was out the $250 or so for a new one.So I did it one more time (with Apply Care).But that's it, when/if this crown cracks I'll go with another brand.Just no excuse whatever for making a sports watch so fragile.none.",2,13
Make sure to have it inspected by a Apple representative,The watch was brand new and I had to call Apple support regarding battery . It would be drained after 8 hours of wear and not even playing music or using fitness tracking or anything.Then 3 days later had issues with the touch screen on the watch.. wojsknr let me touch any app to open it kept taking me to passcode and then it wouldn’t let me put in passcode,2,13
"Convoluted, painful setup, decent fitness tracker/mp3 player once you've spent hours to get there","I can't believe how complicated it is to set up and use this device.I got it for the sole purpose of taking a few of my iTunes playlists to work out with on just the watch and BT headphones. Cause who wants to strap their bulky heavy phone to their arm to workout with?First of all, you should be able to just plug the watch into your PC or sync directly with iTunes through your PC wirelessly. But no, Apple makes you transfer playlists to your iPhone FIRST, THEN transfer to your watch.Ridiculous.And all those itsy-bitsy icons cluttering up the home screen? What moron designed that? He must have had itty bitty fingers.All they had to do was make big icons easy to see and tap, and allow for the removal of any app (Apple or 3rd party) that you don't use. Because even removing all apps possible, there's still like this clutter of 20-some itty-bitty app icons.BUT! Since Apple has made it impossible for other watch/device makers to sync with iTunes I had no choice. And now that I've got it working and know how to use it, it gets the job done.After buying an iPhone I didn't need or want.Thanks a lot, Apple.",3,13
Apple Watch stopped working!!,"I need an upgrade/replacement ASAP.This Apple Watch is less than a year old and has stopped working!!I am ticked off because I can no longer compete for steps with friends or even track my steps.This is the second Apple Watched purchased from Amazon, the first one had no issues yet this one has stopped working completely.I hate this situation!!!!",3,13
New new, This is brand new straight from the apple store. I love it so much,5,13
only compatible iPhone 6s and above model,"I finally have the budget to upgrade to a new Apple Watch,after doing a little research on YouTube and talking to a few friends.the GEN 3, seem like the best bet for my needs. really considered the GEN 5 but definitely over my budget.before you buyWarning warning warning!!!I also had to update my phone The GEN 3 is only compatible with the iPhone 6s and above.I had an iPhone 6 I didn’t even think about the compatibility.After all said and done glad I upgradedI wasn’t expecting on buying a new phone but whatever it was time to upgradeYeah my girlfriend got my old Apple Watch what she is really likingShe likes to fitness features speech to textAnd being able to answer phone callsThe GEN 3 just does it smootherAnd the battery life is amazing I charge the watch every other day",5,13
Great! Until it breaks.,"I purchased the Series 3 in July of 2019, as an upgrade from my Series 1. I love my Apple Watch. I used to roll my eyes when they first came out, how unnecessary was this? When I was gifted a Series 1, I was quickly hooked.Unfortunately, less than one year after purchasing the 3, the glass around the screen broke while I was putting on a sweatshirt. A quick internet search shows that it’s fairly common with this model. I bit the bullet and bought the 5 as a replacement. Hopefully the issue does not repeat with a newer model.",2,13
The best there is!!!,"I don’t need to say anything more about how fantastic this watch is. I was a garmin forerunner holdout for years and finally switched as I wanted a watch to listen to music with while running. The only negative thing I can say about this watch is battery life but I knew that before purchasing it. My solution was using the watch in nightstand mode at night and it’s always charged for a full day of activity. Please note by doing this u can’t use the watch to track sleep but that’s not an issue as i have never had a need to track sleep. I get about 3.5 miles of running in a day and with GPS, heart rate and music playback on and I still have not dipped below 30 percent battery life by the time i take it off to charge at night. The only thing I miss about the garmin ecosystem is the ability to track mileage on my gear/shoes.The reason I am writing a review is to urge u to by Apple Care +. It’s 2.49 a month or 49 dollars for two years of coverage and no I am not associated with Apple. I am just a crazy active person getting about 20k steps a day.I was wearing the watch yesterday while edging the fence line with my gas trimmer. I rolled my ankle on a slope and fell into the fence. The angle must have been just right and hit the upper left corner of the watch off the fence post shattering the screen.I was shocked to find that the cost of the screen replacement on the watch is the exact price I bought it for from amazon. It’s 229. With Apple Care + the cost comes down to 69 dollars. With the care plan u are covered for two years from date of purchase and they allow for two accidental damage repairs over the life of the policy. The only catch is u have to add the plan within 60 days of purchase.That’s all I have to say. I used to say AirPods were the most innovative thing Apple has done in ages but now I feel it’s the watch. Apple pay even more amazing on the watch and being able to voice respond to Tex’s is killer since Apple keeps iMessages locked down to their devices only for the time being.",5,13
Bells and whistles galore,"I was a Fitbit user and the last one I purchased was when I had an Android phone. This past year I switched over to an iPhone and, in hindsight, wished I had an Apple watch. Well, my Fitbit died so I decided to get the Apple 3 watch. I am an elementary teacher and love the discreet convenience of viewing texts and now with the Apple watch phone calls. This 3 is a good value for the price as compared to the newer watches. I figured with the wear and tear at school, I didn't need to spend $400-500 on the latest and greatest based on my basic need for the texting and phone calls. Having said that, I need to spend more time with this watch to learn all the features. I like technology but this is chock full of bells and whistles that I am still learning. Also, watch appeared new with standard high-end Apple packaging. It was charged up but, after pairing with my phone, it did take about 15-20 minutes for the latest software update. It's held its charge fine so far. I have been charging over night but need to see, if I sleep with it like my old Fitbit, how long it will hold the charge.",5,13
"Trouble Pairing with my iPhone, Please Help!!!","I began my smartwatch journey with the Fitbit and have enjoyed my experience with it. Yet, everyone raved about Apple Watch. For quite some time I went back and forth between either staying with Fitbit and updating to the Versa, or making the switch to Apple Watch. Eventually, I took the plunge, and decided to order through Amazon! The watch arrived and looks awesome, seems like exactly what I'll love. BUT, I've been experiencing a terrible time pairing it with my iPhone 7 Plus. Every time I attempt pairing them, the setup process will go to the wrist preference and then pop up with a message that says my watch couldn't pair with my phone. It will then force me to start over and unpair them. I tried restarting both my watch and my phone, and when I went about pairing them this time, it said the watch needed an update before setting up, only to have the same message pop up AGAIN.What can I do to possibly fix this??? I'd really love to keep my watch, but if it simply will not work, my last resort will be returning it and saving up to buy through Apple's website (which I was hoping to avoid since everything on there is sooooo expensive). Any help would be greatly appreciated!!",2,14
Easy Connection with IPhone,"I like how easy and quick it was to connect to my phone and that I can reply to text messages.There are ""canned"" messages and you can use the microphone to voice to text, you can also use your finger to draw the letters and it will recognize them.I didn't like that the instructions were printed in a VERY light grey on white paper???? Why didn't they just print black on the white?I ended up googling the instructions just so I could read them with ease.I wish it had sleep monitoring and EKG, but not willing to pay the difference yet to have that feature (it is on Apple 5 series)",4,14
Sucks,This crap won’t even pair with my 6sPlus although it says it’s compatible. I should have known better than to buy anything from Apple ever again.It keeps unpairing as soon as I pair it and it says my software on the phone is out dated. I just did a fricking update to the latest apple software on my phone which is 12.4. This pisses me off because the watch won’t pair after all the trouble shooting videos on YouTube and from the Apple support team. I want my damn money back and you can keep this crap.,1,14
It’s an Amazing device!,"I love owning an Apple Watch. For Christmas my husband ordered me a series 3 & ever since I have been trying to convince him that he needs one, too. We both had fitbits for a few years, and that’s what I had before my Apple Watch. He went from the FitBit to a Whoop and after several months he decided he didn’t like it, and I was finally able to convince him the Apple Watch was the way to go. Within 2 days, he admitted he should have just gotten the watch like I did instead of the Whoop. As other reviewers have said, you don’t know, until you know, what the hype is about the Apple Watch. My husband & I are both teachers & it’s nice to be able to quickly see what the notification our phones are receiving to determine if it’s important enough to address immediately, once we have a chance, or just later in the day. The Apple Watch has so many features, and I like every single one that I use daily. (I love the activity rings!)",5,14
Apple Watch is great!,"Battery life is as stated. If you put in theater mode it seems to last 2 full days. I’m not a runner or anything like that so if you used the gps more it would probably last a day or less. It comes with same Apple coverage and you can extend the coverage a year. I wouldn’t normally extend but a cracked face means a total replacement and I’ve dropped it twice and hit the face multiple times.I love watches in general, well time pieces in general, but this thing is so cool. I love that you can customize the face and have multiple faces for whatever may suit an occasion. All of the band options that are available is great as well.",5,14
Not as fitness focused as I was wanting,Love the watch. Still trying to figure out the fitness specs. Not as fitness savvy as my old Fitbit as I was expecting.,4,14
Love ig,Love my watch. This is the first Apple Watch that I have owned and I absolutely love it. I ordered the 42mm watch. I have small wrists and was worried it would look to large but it looks great.I wear it every day and put it on the charger before I go to bed. I believe the charge would last at least 24 hours. Since I don’t track my sleep I Charge it while I charge my phone.,5,14
Did not pair with iphone,"I ordered this to use with my iPhone 7 and I had to send it back because it did not pair. I was on the phone with customer service with apple and did all the trouble shooting (had the latest update, restarted phone and watch, reset phone settings and restored watch to default) with no luck. I tried on my wife's phone which works with her watch and didnt pair. Super disapointed!",1,14
2 weeks and Malfunctioning...,"I love the watch. It helps me be on my phone less and has gotten me to be a bit more active. It's a great quality of life gadget. Unfortunately, the screen started to malfunction after 3 weeks of light use! When I look at the watch, it looks as if someone is rapidly swiping up and down and attempting to press all the buttons rapidly. The thing goes completely haywire and I am forced to restart it for a temporary fix.Amazon is sending me a replacement so I'm really hoping this one was a bad seed.",3,14
Modern and nice looking,Got this on sale and was very happy about it. Screen was bright and sharp. Connects well with my Iphone 6S plus.I hope it will last at least 2 years or more before upgrading.,5,14
Love this watch!!!,"Love my series 3 especially for the price. It does more than what I need so I couldn’t justify paying much more for the series 4. I haven’t had it long but love it so far. As most apple products, pretty user friendly and easy to figure out all the different options. The rubber band that it comes with works fine, but does get sweaty underneath while being active so I ordered a new band that I’m excited to try and see how it works. Love the fact you can customize the watch so easily with bands. For sure more “techy” than my fitbits I have had in the past.",5,15
It is fast and battery is okay,"I had the 1st generation Apple Watch and it felt SUPER slow! So decided to buy the 3rd generation and I am glad I did, it is FAR FAR more reliable and quick to perform what you ask it to do. The battery if used normally it lasts me 3 days. Absolutely best watch ever.",5,15
The BEST,"The Apple Watch is the best smart watch you can buy. I love that it tracks your heart rate, sleeping, steps, etc. The watch itself came packaged as expected and works like it should. If you're looking for a great watch, but reasonably priced, the series 3 is your go to. It is not the newest one out, but still functions perfectly and there aren't many changes between 3 and 5 (newest).",5,15
"Great device, excellent value.","I bought the Apple Series 3 40mm mostly as a lark for my birthday. The $199 price point seemed too good to pass up. I’ve never worn a smart watch before, and I have to say...I’m enjoying this watch far more than I imagined. The move tracker is good and I like the calories and workout tracking functions. Checking heart rate during workouts is something I hadn’t been able to do before. It’s also a life saver when you’re out and about. The phone rings or chimes and you don’t have to fish it out of your pocket in the middle of grocery shopping. This is especially nice right now, since we’re wearing masks and trying to minimize surface contact. If you’ve got your AirPods in, you can answer a call without any hassle.Also great for controlling music and podcast playback and volume remotely. I can sit in the pool and change music playing from my phone sitting 20 feet away.All in all, a fun and functional device that looks good and makes using your phone a little more convenient.",5,15
Like an extension of your phone,"It is literally like having a mini phone on your wrist. Great for quickly checking notifications without physically checking your phone when you have company or are busy to where that would be slightly inconvenient. I love the options for its workout tracking and it is accurate in calculating your stair climb and running pace.The music app I use through this is Spotify and it does sometimes lag a bit when controlling the music from you watch. The sleep tracking app is not that accurate. It overestimates with sleep saying you went to sleep earlier than you really did but it is cool checking out the cycles of sleep you went through throughout the night.I will say you should get some kind of screen protection. I have had it for about a month now and already have minor scratching around the screen, nothing major though.",4,15
Won’t Pair With My Phone,Really was looking forward to the watch but when it got here it wasn’t able to pair I tried for hours going through every tutorial and calling apple... NOTHING WORKED. I am disappointed in amazon. If you want an Apple Watch just get it from the Apple store itself. There is no problem with my phone...,1,15
Wish battery life was longer,"What I like about this product: I like the user interface and being able to seamlessly connect it to my iPhone. Paying with my Apple watch (especially during the pandemic) is a huge plus since I don't have to touch my phone out in public!What I *really* dislike: The battery life to this thing is abhorrent. Many people charge their Apple watches over night, but I like keep it on to see my sleep cycle. This gives me short amounts of time to charge it during the day (during breakfast, after work for a bit). I hope the next model significantly improves in this area, but until then--this will have to do.",2,15
Used or refurbished don’t buy from amazon,"Last year I bought the same watch from Apple store and it was awesome but anyway I gave that watch to my brother and again bought the same watch from amazon. What I can feel that something is not right, especially battery how can battery be drained in few hours when I’m not even using it . I think it was used or refurbished. My advice is not to buy apple products from amazon, it was 20$ cheap in comparison to apple store but don’t fall for that trap as they are used or have some technical problems.",3,15
"Yes, the Series 3 is still worth buying","Researched and contemplated whether to get the series 3 or 4. I wasn’t looking for a smart watch but the reduced price of the series 3 intrigued me. I’ve had it for 1 week and I love it and all of the features. I had a cheap fitness tracker before and didn’t wear it everyday but liked having a basic tracker. I can already see that I’ll be wearing my Apple smart watch everyday. My wife has the series 4 and she loves it as well, but the series 3 is perfect for me at less than $200 and the same software that’s running in the latest model.",5,15
Love!,"I have never been one to get too excited over technology, but this watch is amazing! Since I live in MN and the laws are changing August 1st regarding cell phones and driving, I'm very happy to have a way to answer phone calls and be in compliance. Very easy to set up and sync music; love the different features like the heart rate monitor and fitness tracker. Only downside is the limited battery life - I haven't lost a charge yet, but making sure I plug in every night can be a hassle as I'm a forgetful person. Overall, great product, very pleased!",5,15
Very sleek design and great product all together,My husband loves his Apple Watch and wears it every day. Battery life for the both of us is about 2 days before we have to sit it on the charger. We don’t shower with ours on but it seems to hold up great when washing our hands and things like that. I’m sure it would be fine in the shower but it’s juer a personal performance not to for us.,5,16
Great watch to motivate you to move more!,"I got this watch during quarantine, and even though I've kept up with my exercise routine, my overall activity level has decreased since I'm not biking to school or walking between classes (I'm a recently graduated high school senior going into college in a few weeks). This watch is good motivation to get my steps in and get out of the house; it's easy to lose motivation when there isn't much going on, so this has been very helpful for keeping my overall activity level high enough. The wide variety of fitness tracking features are convenient, and they seem accurate for the most part. They obviously aren't going to give you perfect data, but as long as they are consistent day to day it's a good way to compare your activity levels.As a smart watch, this watch has a lot of small features that are really convenient once you start using them. Music control is nice if you are playing music through a speaker, and it will buzz when you're nearing a turn following a route on Apple Maps. This has saved me from blowing past turns and exits quite often. The battery life has been totally adequate for me, although I'm almost always using it in conjunction with my phone; having the watch run by itself can drain it quicker, although I'm rarely below 40% battery life by the end of the day.This is my first smart watch, and I am very pleased with it. It has surpassed my expectations and there aren't any big criticisms I have so far. It's comfortable, customizable, easy to use, and helpful for a wide variety of lifestyles.",5,16
Won’t pair to my IPhone XR,"Purchased Aug 22, brand new out of box. And it won’t pair to my iPhone XR. I just got this phone so it’s not the phone. The watch seems to be defective ugh. Contacting apple support to confirm.Edit: after being on the phone with tier 2 apple support, amazon support, for an 2 hour over 2 days the device was oddly defective for Apple after resetting watch and phone, powering off both, and resetting network settings. Watch still won’t pair. Getting a refund.",1,16
Love it,"Love it. My first Apple Watch, so I bought the series 3 to see if I’d like it. Love the activity tracker, made me totally aware of how sedentary my daily routine had become - especially since I began working at home because of the pandemic. Now I stand up and move around more. Also like making and receiving phone calls without having to hold my phone- and being able to screen calls just looking at my wrist is great. There are so many great features that I can’t list them all.I use Bluetooth to connect the watch to my phone, so my phone must be with me to use the watch- this works fine for me. Also, I have gotten it wet with no problems, but I have not submerged it in water, although it is advertised to be splash/swim- proof. I also got Apple Care because I am accident prone.",5,16
"Glad I Waited, Glad I Purshased!","I'm so glad I waited for the Series 3. I pretty much own most Apple Products. From the Original 2007 iPhone, to the AirPad, to the MacBook Pro and right up to the iPhone 11. But, I never seemed interested in the Apple Watch. I didn't think it did much at its first Launch. But now with the latest Watch OS 6.1.1, this Series 3 is Fantastic! i love responding to texts, even rejecting call right from my wrist. I love the simple controls as well, when listening to iHeartRadio, Pandora or any Streaming service from my iPhone. At this price, it's the Perfect Choice! I do recommend!",5,16
Battery sucks,"I’ve been wanting an Apple watch for a long time. I don’t mind this watch but the battery doesn’t last as long as they claim, mine last a day, maybe a day half if I push it. You can’t delete all the apps you don’t use, they just sit there and take up space and battery. However, I’m super impressed with the range it reaches, I can leave my phone in the house downstairs and I can be way out in my gardenand it reaches 98% of my giant backyard. Siri doesn’t like to listen to you and and I would like to be able to turn the vibration up but I would buy this watch again if I needed to. Also, one last complaint, I don’t like that if you’re wearing the watch it only tells you have a notification through the watch and not the phone (unless you have your phone open).",4,16
"Fragile glass edges, good features otherwise.","Cons first,A) really poor battery life, have to charge it every single day.B)I have this complaint about many apple products. They have too much emphasis on style and not enough on function. The glass face of this watch should be encased in a frame for support but all 4 sides wrap around to the back of watch leaving the edges very vulnerable to breaking. I use this to track my athletic events, it should be built to withstand that. Make a sport and an office executive model, one sturdy, one flashy.The pros:A) looks really nice <U+0001F606>B) Has a number of compatible fitness apps, with Fitbit you just have their layout.Great clock face options.C) overall good performance.",4,16
Great Apple Watch!,So far it’s great! Love all the features the Apple Watch comes with especially the message speech to text!,5,16
DO NOT BUY THROUGH AMAZON,"I LOVE an Apple Watch, so much so that after 3 years mine died and I am buying a second.For whatever reason I got a dud. They will not allow me to return it despite on the site it saying I can. I have been through 4 customer care reps and spent too much time ""trouble shooting"" this product as they will not allow you to return it without going through their reset process. I have been through 4 reps as it must be their break time but they just leave and assign you someone else and you have to START ALL OVER every time. I will buy from Apple, Costco, Target, you name it but NOT FROM AMAZON. I love Amazon, but this is not the product to buy from them. On the Apple Watch, you won't regret it. So convenient. So convenient that I found it hard to go the 2 days without one once mine died!!!DOn't start with it if you don't want to be addicted and fall in love with it :)",1,16
Buy a band on amazon,"I love my watch.I charge it each night and don’t use it for sleep monitoring but days I forgotten to charge it, the battery will last into at least lunch the next day and I’ll just charge it at work during my lunch break.It’s great for getting text because I supervise a team and if I’m in a meeting elsewhere in the building I can see they text me and make sure it’s not an emergency without constantly checking my phone.My son plays with the toy story face and it’s nice to get those notifications when you reach your steps",5,16
Love it. Use it everyday!,"I bought mine to track my fitness and the Apple Watch does not disappoint. I had a couple of cheaper devices that didn’t record a .lot of data and struggled to sync with my phone but the Apple Watch does everything I need it to. I do keep a case on it to make sure it doesn’t get scratched ams hopefully protect it from getting cracked. I have larger wrists but I bought the 38mm because I am losing weight and my wrists are already thinnning out. Figured the larger size ,igniting look weird over time. I also really like getting my notifications on my wrist because since I have little kids napping in my house every afternoon it’s hard to leave my ringer on and not have the, be disturbed. Also the alarm on it really helps to make sure that when it goes off it only vibrates on my wrist and doesn’t wake anyone else up.",5,17
I love this watch <U+231A><U+FE0F>,"I never understood why people loved apple watches. I’ve always been the type of person who judged others for spending their money on it until I recently went on a Smartwatch crazy. My partner has a Samsung galaxy watch and I went crazy doing research for the perfect watch for my iPhone 6s. Turns out every Smartwatch, from TicWatch to Garmin and Samsung, wasn’t “compatible” with my phone. I decided to get this Apple Watch 3 instead of the 4 because it was cheaper. I got it when it was on sale for $199 dollars which is a deal I couldn’t miss. I’m in love with it, I only take it off when I sleep and it’s such a fashion statement. I get to see all my notifications and track my fitness, listen to music, make calls and answer texts. GPS version isn’t bad at all, works perfectly for my preference because i didn’t want to pay extra for cellular. I highly recommended this watch.Ps: don’t buy another magnetic charger like I did (oopsies) it already comes with that, plus an m/L watch band for those with bigger wrists :)",5,17
Worth the expense,"I kept debating buying one of these bad boys, that is until there was a sudden price drop and a credit that amazon thought would be great to give me, so I jumped on the deal. I’ve never been huge on wearing watches, but the watch was super comfortable and not anywhere near as obnoxious as any other watch I’ve owned. The battery lasts almost 3 days for me, and just about 2 for my wife, even with constant use. I can use way more features of my phone from my watch than I expected and there are even some fun features that I didn’t know about like the walk-in talkie. Definitely worth the buy",5,17
Great deal,"Got the 42mm black Apple Watch for 229. Best Buy and Apple had it for around 279-300, so I’m glad I went to amazon! Got it on time, came in the original Apple packaging, brand new. I’m so happy with the watch itself but also satisfied with the price I got it for.",5,17
LOVE,"I LOVE my watch!!! It was between an apple watch series 3 and a fitbit charge 3. I went back and forth between the two for awhile after much researching, and decided on the apple watch. I am thrilled with my decision. With the price being $199 and the fitbit charge 3 being $149. I felt that I liked more of the apple features and look. I walked through best buy playing with both and the apple watch was more of what I wanted. I have only positive things to say!",5,17
not good for tracking steps,"I miss my FitBit Charge which worked so much better for a podometer.Any arm movement with this watch will track as steps so when I am knitting, I can go well over 10K steps.This then gives a bogus reading on the calories burned.I got this instead of replacing my fitbit charge because of the extra features, however, for what I was using, I miss the step tracker on the fitbit.It is convenient, however, to answer my watch instead of looking for my cell phone.",4,17
Better than expected and good value,"After years of using a Fitbit that easily gave me 5 days between charges, my greatest hesitation was battery life, but this watch has been great and the battery has delivered much better than expected. Love the connectivity to my iPhone and appreciate the full integration. Considering the price difference between this and the newest models, it's well worth it. I'm very happy with this purchase and can't imagine preferring the available alternatives at this point.",4,17
Good customer service. TERRIBLE professionalism,Wish I could give it 0 stars. I had high hopes with this product as i ordered an iPhone through amazon and it works fine and had zero issues. When going through the setup it said it was locked with the previous owners information and when I contacted amazon support they contacted Apple and they informed me that they can’t do anything with the product and I would have to contact the previous owner. Now that I can’t do anything and I have to return it there are no watches any where near the price this one was. Completely disappointed with this as it should have been caught before the product was shipped.,1,17
I love my new watch!,"I received a great deal and finally took the jump and purchased this Series 3.I am so glad I did.I thought the band was very comfortable however the smaller section was just a smidge too tight and caused some sweating underneath.I switched to the longer version and voila!Great fit!I love it that you can buy and replace the bands so easily.I have three more coming with a case (highly recommend a case).I'm afraid of bumping it and cracking the screen so I ordered a case just for that reason.The repair costs is the same as a new watch!I don't want that!The battery life seems ok for me, and the apps seem to work flawlessly.So many options to customize the watch!LOVE IT!",5,17
Apple Prevents Free Audiobooks From Being Transfered,"Listening to audiobooks without my phone while working out is the only use case this watch would have served me. And it's absolutely insane I can't really do that. If you get a legally free audiobook from LibriVox you cannot listen to it on your Apple Watch. How crazy is that? They actively block it so the only way to listen to audiobooks is buy it from them or sign up for Audible and use the Audible app.Let me elaborate. The only acceptable way to listen to audiobooks is to use the Apple Watch's Audiobook or Podcasts apps. Developers of some great 3rd Party audiobook iPhone apps say they can't offer watch-only listening on their apps because Apple's API doesn't let them transfer files to the watch. So the built-in Apple apps are the only option. If you tag an MP3 files as audiobooks in iTunes and sync it to your iPhone, it shows up in your phone's iBooks and work just fine. But the Apple Watch version of the app ignores these files since they weren't purchased from Apple. It's absurd.",1,17
Great watch,"I purchased this watch because I have a desk job and on top of that, I am now working from home like many others this year. I’ve noticed I haven’t been active as much because I get so invested in work that I forget to do much else. I wanted a reminder to get up and move and do something else other than sitting at my desk all day. Sure, there are cheaper ways to remind yourself to stand up and walk around but I loved all the other features I read up on as well. I feel like I can more comfortably step away from my work knowing I’ll get notified of any emails, texts, or calls on my watch. Closing the rings has become a daily activity and overall, I’ve found the watch very useful and it allows me to feel a bit less tethered to my desk! So if you’re working a desk job, you may find this useful as well.",5,18
Lasted a month,"Unfortunately, my watch was perfect until it wasn’t. A little over a month after I bought it, it won’t charge or turn on. It just has the green charge symbol with the chord on the screen. I’ve read that this means it’s just DONE. I used my watch all day, every day. So, I must say I’m pretty bummed.",2,18
LOVE Love the 42mm on my small wrist!,"I never thought I’d own a Apple iwatch.I have my iPad and iPhone and didn’t see the need for the watch.I wanted to experiment so I went with the Series 3 as the price was fair.I first purchased the 38mm thinking it would be big enough for my tiny wrists not having anything to compare it with. After seeing what the 38mm was like, I felt the screen size needed to be a tad bigger.I sent back the 38mm and reordered a 42mm.I have to say I LOVE IT!!!!That small increase in the face size makes a world of difference!And the bonus is the battery lasts a little longer.I’m not much of a watch person but now I have a reason to wear one.I love that I can put my phone down in my house and be able to get calls, texts and notifications including if I’m out front or back. I’m still in the WiFi area able to receive connection.Definitely consider the bigger size as you will not be disappointed!!!",5,18
A disappointment,Was really excited about getting an Apple Watch. Sadly it’s a bust. Doesn’t pair to my iPhone 8 Plus. Will have to waste my time and go to a store to see if they can do anything about it. If not I will be returning for a full refund.,1,18
Had it sent out to Apple for diagnostic,"Reason for the two stars. My 2 hour wait with Apple, and 2 hours of them having me trying to connect my IPhone XR to my Apple Watch. From what Apple told the watch is not loaded with the latest software, so if you have the newest version on your phone your unlikely able to connect yours as well. I have not received my watch back yet, or a answer on why it keep failing. Shipping was quick though so that was a plus.",2,18
From Fitbit charge dos to Apple Watch series trey.,"Decided to leave the Fitbit family after 2 and a half years. Right off the bat, I see that the battery life and the lack of sleep tracking make this product fall slightly behind the Fitbit product when it comes to fitness and health. Entertainment wise, the Apple Watch is years ahead of Fitbit and the fact that it syncs with my iphone makes it so easy to use. It’s convenient and it also Makes me feel like a basic b****. Give you all another update in three months.",5,18
Probably not a great purchase for me.,"So the product probably does exactly what it is supposed to do.The issue is that I guess I got caught up in the hype and though the watch was a life changer and it really isn’t.Truth is if I stopped using it today I would not miss it.I am sticking with it however hoping that maybe I will discover more uses for it later but from what I have seen so far, and from talking to others with the watch and from the online training that I have found I don’t think that will happen.It tells time and a couple other “neat” things like heart rate and keeping track of time spend during workouts but other than that not much else.",2,18
Not Durable,"I debated for months before purchasing this product. After reading reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase. However, now I wish I had read reviews elsewhere as well because I regret purchasing it. After having this product for a month and half, with a screen protector and a bumper on it, a crack appeared on the screen (with no impact). Looking at reviews on other websites, this is apparently a common issue with this version of the watch. The crack wasn't a huge cosmetic issue, but the screen stopped responding to touch because of it. Contacted apple support, but they refused to fix it unless I paid more than I purchased the watch itself for to repair it. Faulty product. Horrible customer service.",1,18
Great Battery Life. Smarter than it appears.,"I bought this watch but became bored of it after a while. However, the notifications and ability to respond is great and I use the watch almost daily. The phone app is also very user friendly and very useful. After having owned it for a while, this watch never fails to surprise me with the functions it has, such as detecting and tracking exercise, or being able to be used to control music on Bluetooth earphones. EASILY worth the money.",5,18
Incredible purchase,"I don’t use it for sleep tracking as I charge it every night during sleep, however I believe that given the technology that the watch has, if you intended to use it for sleep tracking it would be effective. The videos I saw about the watch online were mostly vain, and honestly my friends that own the watch sold me on it more than any online material. even videos displaying the capabilities of the watch don’t give it a solid and thorough review. Seeing friends and now my own watch, I see that the series 3 is now beyond worth the value due to price drops since the 5. everyone complains that the new series only have marginal improvements, but when you look at the nonmarginal price effect on older series, I’m all for them releasing new watches frequently as long as there are some (even marginal) improvements. The series 3 at 220$ vs the series 5 at 750$, the series 3 is more than cost effective, and might I add beautiful.",5,18
Charger does not work.,"The shipment was fast. Everything is as described. Except for the charger. I’ve used the watch for one day and i turned on power reserve mode. Then I put it on charge over night. Still doesn’t work. I’ve tried charging it through the plug adapter and also my computer. It does work. And the worst part is when I look up on Apple help, it tells me to hold on to the side button until it shows an Apple logo. It never showed up. Nothing. I tried holding different buttons no matter how long 10 seconds a minute. Still on power reserve mode, even after leaving it on charge for overnight. I’ve previously bought a watch from Apple store, normally when it’s on power reserve mode, and you charge it it changes to a big green lightening showing that it’s on charge. But this does not show anything. What I think this watch could be refurbished, and some things are malfunctioning due to can not charge. Please consider this before buying it.",1,19
Awesome watch you didn’t know you needed till you get it.,"I love my iWatch,like most people, I didn’t know what I was missing until I had one and now I don’t get up without putting it on for the day. It’s been super handy as it vibrates and rings when people call or text and so I don’t miss near as many calls. I like the activity app! Witch integrates data from the iWatch Strava app without problem. I love the Strava app for my cycling cpu and it works awesome on the iWatch. I get my heart rate, distance, mph, average mph, time, elevation gain, Ect. From my iWatch. Love it!",5,19
"Yes, you do need a watch to make you get off your butt! LOL","I have long held out on buying a fitness watch stating that I didn't need a device to tell me I need to workout or get up off the couch. Well.....I was wrong. At first it annoyed me, now I go to battle with it everyday to achieve my workout goals. Having said that, it does not let you increase the amount of time you would like to exercise or how many hours you want to stand and move for one minute. Your stuck with the preprogrammed times of 30 minutes and once every hour for 12 hours respectively. The only thing you can change is your move goal (calories burned daily). I do love that you can share your activity with other watch owners. I find the encouragement, support and competition enjoyable.",5,19
"Very disappointed! Doesn't work and can't return have to ""repair""","I received this product on 7/1. Haven't been able to use it yet because the screen goes black every time I select an app. I've spent hours on the phone with support to try and resolve the issue. Called Amazon support they didn't help, they sent me to Apple. Called Apple support they are asking me to send it in for ""repair"". Brand new product that doesn't work and no one will exchange it for another. I am extremely disappointed in the customer service from both organizations.",1,19
The Apple 3 is worth the money!,"I am so happy with my purchase of the Apple 3 watch. I was recently using the Fitbit, but I had a lot of issues with it (two watches to be exact), so I decided to try Apple.THE BEST DECISION!I chose the Apple 3 because of the price and also because it does everything I need it to do. It also rated very high on Amazon and from a friend.It is waterproof, so I can swim with it on, as well as walk, run, or whatever else I chose to do. I can receive texts and phone calls and monitor my heart rate.I also like the feature that allows me to share/compete with a friend(s) and the little token awards along the way to keep me motivated.",5,19
SuperWatch!,I got this as a present for my wife who has always wanted one but was unsure if the cost was justified. I decided to start her off with the Series 3 watch. She loves it. She can quickly respond to texts without needing her phone nearby and she can answers calls through the watch as well. Also one of her favorite things is how easily she can change watchbands to fit her changing style or seasons. This is a great buy and will definitely recommend to others,5,19
"Great for my needs, better then I expected.","Very nice watch, easy to set up but it takes a little why to pair it with your device (~10 minutes).Very stylish.I had to order a separate band because my wrist is quite big and the original one wouldn’t even reach around, but it’s not their fault because an 8” wrist isn’t very commonMany designs of faces to pick from, although I hate every other design except modular.",5,19
Good for workouts but can’t hold a charge,"It’s an Apple Watch, so the critiques are for the watch itself, not the listing. It came on time and nothing was broken. Charger worked well too. The watch itself has a rather poor charge hold and I can never use the sleep tracking because it would be dead by morning. Oh, don’t even try to take it into the pool. It says water resistant and it has a pool workout, but my last one broke after only a few strokes out. That all being said, I do love it for normal workouts or just a busy day. I can change my songs without navigating through a menu, workout tracking is pretty accurate, and you can create your own watch face.",5,19
Great Delivery AndBest Smart Watch,"Well I am using this watch from last one yearand want to saythatitssimply Awesome !!This was my firstwatch which I purchaseda year beforebutbased on its performanceandfeatures it encourageto givethis review.This apple smart watch and appsaregood,Looks classic though bought 3stripsfrom amazon :).The onlything I dont like is the price of this product,Lol obvious its apple and cantexpectprice lower than this.Over all I am happy to have this watch andit keeps track of all my health .I like the Amazon expediency and range of products—- makes my shopping for gifts so easy and affordable.",4,19
It’s legit,"This is my third or fourth apple watch. I keep breaking them but they are addictive. I broke my last one and didn’t get extended coverage bc the way they break is covered by product warranty. However, last time, it wasn’t! Smh it would have cost $250 to get a series 3 replacement. I found this and got the warranty. The way that it break always breaks is, the face detaches from the watch so, I got the face protector this time. It came brand new w/ the charger and extra band. I had to update and sync and it was good to go. I’m pleased with my purchase",5,19
They are overpriced,Yes apple is bad,1,20
MISSING THE WATCH IN THE BOX,"Be cautious about buying the used model from Amazon Warehouse. I received a box with the charging cable, 1/2 wrist strap, AND NO WATCH! I’ve been a Amazon Prime member for nearly 8 years and have never seen anything like this happen before.",1,20
Get one,"Upgraded from the original Apple Watch. This one tracks my exercise so much better. I rated the sleep tracking 1/5 because this watch doesn’t do that... There’s supposed to be one released at the end of 2020 that tracks sleep. But I like this watch for reading texts, tracking exercise, and even answering calls is great quality. Couldn’t go a day without it! I love not having to have my phone on me all the time and this watch makes that possible.",5,20
Dissapointing,This has been a real disappointment in so many ways.Battery life is horrible and you have to charge it every day. It lack basic capabilities that other cheaper tracker have like sleep tracking. The automatic tracking of activities works poorly. And the app is not the most intuitive and to find information on the watch is lacking and difficult to find.Not worth the money.,2,20
The Apple Watch is really a great addition to my devices.,"I’m loving my watch.Still learning more about it every day.Getting messages, email and everything I need right on my wrist.Love the activity function.It really encourages me to be more active.My favorite thing to do is ask it to set a timer when I cook or wash clothes.The only reason I didn’t give it 4 stars is the band.I bought two more bracelet style bands and replaced that white plastic band.It made my wrist sweat.",4,20
Beware!,"Received this watch brand new in an unopened box and it would not pair with my iPhone, after an hour trying and on the phone with Apple support I had to send it in to Apple and get a replacement. It took a lot of time and effort to get a working watch. Disappointing!",1,20
LOVE my new iWatch,"I transitioned from a Fitbit to an iWatch and boy, was the difference HUGE! I love the interactivity and synchronization with your iPhone. It took me a short minute to figure out the difference but the fact that I can answer calls without having to pull out the phone while its near me is so helpful and also pretty cool :) Overall, it's an awesome product by Apple and would recommend it to all! Totally worth it.",5,20
Will not pair with an iPhone 6,"We already own one of these watches and it works great with my iPhone 7. I liked it so much that I bought one for my wife. Unfortunately, she has an iPhone 6 and the series 3 comes preloaded with WatchOS6 and will not pair with an iPhone 6 or older. You must have at least an iPhone 6s. We have owned many Apple products over the years and this is the first time that I can say that Apple blew it. There are still lots of iPhone 6 in use so it seems crazy to not support compatibility between the watch and iPhone 6. Especially when all they would need to do is allow the user to back down to Watch OS 5.",3,20
Love it,Like all Apple products I love it easy to use easy to setupI traded from a Fitbit Ionic to this watch no issues with my Fitbit but I have an iPhone and iPad figured must have the watchMy only complaint so far is battery life can barely get 24 hrs on it I know it does more than my Fitbit did but I was getting 3 or 4 days on a charge with itGuess I may half to turn off some options to see if it lasts longer,5,20
Love! Super motivating for work outs!," Apple Watch series 3 is amazing. For a first time smart watch owner this is all you need. I chose the earlier model because you can’t beat the price and I didn’t need things like the EKG heart monitoring the series 5 has. The rings are super motivating to complete each day. And honestly being able to ping your cellphone from your watch is so helpful! I bought a more slim band than what came with it and I am really happy with this purchase. Only downside is the battery life is terrible. I have to charge it everyday, but I usually do it while I’m cooking dinner after I get home so I’m not missing out on tracking too much. All in all, if this is your first watch and you’re on the fence, I say go for it. It’s a steal of a deal for what you get.",5,20
Easy,"I can see all the readings I want to see at a glance; time, calories, minutes of workout completed and number of hours standing. And when it's time to do a workout, I just click on the little runner in the top right corner and choose a workout. I used a Fitbit before this and had to hope it recognized my workout. Not to knock Fitbit, I had a very basic model, so a comparable one might do some of the same things. Oh, and if I pop something in the oven and need to do other things, I turn my wrist and say 'set a time for 40 minutes"" and it does. It's the little things. I'm in love with this watch.I used the word love.",5,21
Exactly what I was looking for!,I went back and forth between getting an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. I’m so happy with the Apple Watch. I love that it connects to my phone so easily. Looking forward to using the built in GPS to track runs outside. Also love that I’m able to read and respond to texts from the watch as I don’t always have my phone by me. Only 2 stars for battery because mine keeps dying or I wake up to less than 10% battery after it being charged fully the day before. I’ve made some setting adjustments so hopefully fix this issue.,5,21
So happy that I bought it,"I'd tried to use a number of other fitness trackers to avoid buying this watch. I thought that it was just too expensive. What a mistake. Trying to go a less expensive route just cost money, time, and frustration that I could have avoided if I had just bought the apple watch. It's more than all the other trackers could ever offer. I wish that I had purchased it earlier. It really is so good and so much more than I wanted but never knew I needed. Save yourself some trouble and get this watch.",5,21
It’s cool," Overall I’m happy with the watch. I’m still learning all the features. I haven’t figured out sleep tracking which if the watch does in fact have I would love to open up. I upgraded from a Fitbit to this and am missing the sleep tracking that my Fitbit gave me. Probably something I need to open or download so I will keep exploring for that.The battery life is pretty much for the day. I can get through about a day and a half.I just learned that I need to clear/clean the speakers after swimming which is an easy fix on the watch.Overall, I’m happy with it",5,21
"I love it, only had it about two weeks though","I love having my text messages on my wrist when I'm not near my phone.I got this to replace my fitbit which I was having problems with.So far it works great.I don't know about water resistance because I'm trying my best to keep it away from water.Sweat doesn't seem to bother it though.I don't love that you have to get a separate app to track your sleep, but its an apple product, you seem to have to have a separate app for everything.",5,21
Love my watch.,"Besides tell time, I don't have to carry my phone to track my steps each day.It reminds me to stand up and move if I sit at my desk too long and reminds my to stop and just breath for a minute.You can customize a lot of things and make it unique for you.I don't like the watch band, but you can buy many types for it and they are easy to change.I got a dressy one and an everyday one.",5,21
What a bummer - item is a lemon,"I purchased this watch just 3 months ago along with Apple Care.In the last 2 weeks I have spent 3 hours on the phone with Apple Care because this watch just plain sucks.The heart rate monitor is off - so much that it will tell me that I've burned 175 calories in a 45 minute spin class (Yeah, I'm the instructor - so basically it's saying I'm practically dead and not moving).Over time, the calories burned are lower and lower by hundreds.How do I know?Well, I've put on another Apple Watch on my right wrist and it's coming up 200+ more calories burned on the same workout.Now, the last 2 weeks it just shuts off for no reason at all.Apple will not help me get a replacement so I'm pretty sure I was sent a refurb or a bad watch.Sucks that I spent the money on something that just isn't up to Apple or Amazon standards.",1,21
"So Far, So Good.","This Apple Watch series 3 is working fantastically, one month in.The battery life is not great, it needs to be charged a few times each week. Mobile apps, messaging, calls, etc., all work very well. The band is not annoying on my skin, and the materials are durable, surviving light banging and knocking against things like door frames and walls.My one concern so far is that occasionally, the color scheme will change when I look at the watch. Rather than the colors I've selected, the watch will occasionally show blue-green hues for a few moments. I will try to post pictures if I can capture it in the future.",5,21
Great Technology but Native Fitness Tracking App Comparatively Sparse on Data and Functionality,"I was looking for a device that provides in-depth data regarding sleep and fitness tracking. In my experience, the native apps did not provide the detail I expected when compared to a Garmin, at least not without considerable searching within the Health app.Aside from that, this is a great watch that's of exceptional build quality, and the Apple warranty and customer service are exceptional. It just fell short in the areas most important to me. I find with the Garmin that I can still use my iPhone to do many things that this watch did (more conveniently,) and the Garmin needs to be recharged less frequently.",3,21
Love it,"My primary goal in purchasing a smart watch was to use it for running. I wanted a GPS to track my miles and a music player so I didn't have to carry my phone. This watch has provided this flawlessly and so much more that I never expected to want or to use. I love that I don't feel the need to have my phone in my pocket at all times because I can text, email, and talk with the watch and ignore messages that just aren't that important. It has worked flawlessly with my iPhone. I loved it so much I bought one for my sister for her birthday and she loves it too!",5,21
I now see the worldwide hype on theApple watch,"I see why this is the best smart watch out there! I'm so happy they made this series such a good price because it's truly just as good as the series 4 and 5. Everything about this watch is clutch. Arrived 3 days early, installation was super easy, the bands are so easy to remove and you can find different colors and sizes for cheap all over the internet. Lets you add your Cards for apple pay, has all those health features and so so much more. I'm telling you I got this for girlfriend and it's the best present and one she will enjoy so much. Take advantage of this while you can!!",5,22
There are no free apps for this watch! <U+0001F616>,"I haven’t been able to find the sleep tracker on this watch yet and I do NOT want to pay for an appeither.For pete sakes, even a Fitbit has the sleep tracker.Since this is an Apple 3 watch, I was hoping there was a bit more to it when I purchased it, but I’m finding that this watch isn’t all that and a bag of chips!I fail to see why the prices are still so high on this model yet I cannot afford the Apple 5 watch that is a whopping $699.I’m going to give it a little more time to see if it is worth keeping.Not a delightful happy camper on this buy.",3,22
May have saved my dad’s life,"We bought this for my dad for Father’s Day, 3 days later the watch notified him that his resting heart rate was high (140 bpm).He went to the emergency room and was eventually diagnosed with AFib and will have to control it with meds.The watch may have prevented a stroke or saved his life.",5,22
"Love, love, love it!! Does so much more!!","I have wanted an Apple Watch for a long time but not bad enough to pay $300+I mostly wanted to keep track of steps and motivate myself more to burn more calories. I tried to talk myself into another watch to keep track of steps etc. but for the price I was hesitant due to hearing how they would break or crack after a year or two.I love all my Apple products TV, laptop, tablet and iPhone!! So when I saw this Apple Watch at a price I could justify I went for it!! Wow!! It does so much more than I ever new. I was so motivated the first week with the activity app I was getting 15,000 + steps a day and lost two pounds. I am having so much fun with it answered a call on it and my daughter said it sounded the same. The GPS on the phone is awesome too!! Okay that’s enough! Enjoy!!",5,22
Watch they sent me was defective.,The Apple Watch they sent me was defective. I took it to the Apple store and they confirmed it. Ended up spending a little bit more money on a watch at the Apple store. Will be returning this watch for a full refund,1,22
The face will automatically movefrom regular face to a magnifying size and can't view apps,"Settings will magnify without me touching the settings on the face. Watch will change settings from normal size to a distortedsize . Very disappointment because I really didn't want to purchase another one but the front on my old one popped off and I was told the battery blew up which from others this has happened to is a common thing with I-watches. I called customer serviceand the young lady was very nice but had no Idea how to assist me with my issue. Although she tried but she had no idea what to do. For the amount you pay for these watches there should be a longer period to return it, This watch started acting up after 2/3 weeks of wearing it and after the 4th week I was going to return it as a defect and the return period had passed by 4 days.",2,22
It's about the way you feel,"Apple watch might be considered to be hyped but the quality that Apple offers in its products is beyond any questions. I got a 42mm because I felt 38mm watch would be smaller for my wrist size and I was right.This watch was perfect on my wrist and I cannot feel better after purchasing this watch.It is very easy to set-up and use and also makes using your Iphone easier. Now, i don't have to take my phone out of my pocket every minute to check the notifications.It also tracks my fitness.I'd definitely recommend this watch to any buyer. It is very much in fashion and at the same time, the technology is not all that old as in Apple Watch 1 and 2.",5,22
Love how easy it is,"I really like this watch. I recently switched from a Fitbit to the Apple Watch and here’s the pros and consPro: talk to text, works much better with an iPhone, fair amount of apps such as weather I can view on the watch, water resistantCons: sleep trackers are a joke (the main thing I miss from my Fitbit) and the battery life.",5,22
"Great, but some iffy things started happening","Bought this back in June, worked great for 3 months and then suddenly it would glitch a lot. Like I had a password on it and then it would get stuck on the keys when I tried to enter it. I just took it off because I was tired of delaying with it. Lately I’ve been having more problems with getting stuck on screens and just like being all glitchy and getting stuck on different screens I may be using. I’ve had to hard resent it a few times and that seemed to fix the problem.Not sure if the glitches are due to the newest update or because I bought it through amazon where a lot of epitope have had problems with their watches. Like the hey sent us defector watches. Not sure, hopefully just the newest update and not the watch. Otherwise that’s really disappointing of amazon to treat its customers like that.",3,22
Will not work with iPhone 6s,Every review I read said this would work with iPhone 5s and up. My son has a 6s and it would not pair with it after googling what was on the watch screen I found that the phone was compatible but the watch itself had been updated so it would not work. Just wanted other people to be aware.,2,22
How it came,"I ordered this product on April, 2 and I was told it would arrive on April 7th then it moved to April 8thbut luckily I got the package early. Overall the packaging was nice came in perfect condition came with a charger and an extra strap for a m/l wrist. Happy with the product easy to use but takes a bit to set up.Edit: so the battery life is great I was using it all day went on a jog and walk. I woke up at 9:30 am and put it on the charger at midnight and it was 65% impressive battery life!!!!",4,23
What haven’t I had this watch all along?, This watch has made communicating and tracking health goals much more easy. I am constantly in meetings and it helps to be able to do quick replies without reaching for my phone. The watch is much more accurate than any Fitbit I have owned. I highly recommend it!,5,23
Love It,"I owned the Series 1 prior.The battery life on the 3 is outstanding; I've gone almost 2 full days without charging. (With my Series 1, I'd be lucky to make it to bed-time before it died)It seems to track activity better than the Series 1 did, and I LOVE the waterproof feature.I was dying for an activity tracker I could take swimming.Negative remarks on sleep tracking because, in my personal opinion, it is too bulky to wear to bed. Also, the light will shine in my face if I move my wrist (tummy sleeper here)... so on the dock it goes",5,23
Great watch,I was on the face about buying series 3 after breaking my series 5 Apple Watch. I know the new 6 will be out soon so I figured for less than half the price of the 5 this is not a bad deal. Most of the extra ting like ECG on the 5 I never used. I find for my purposes the 3 covers all the bases. Now if the series 6 comes out and it is a must have $200 was not a bad investment rather than $429 for series 5. They both are great watches it just depends on your needs. Even though it’s a little bit of a downgrade I am completely satisfied.,5,23
STOP WORKING AFTER 5 MONTHS,"ZERO STARS!If you’re curious to know what the inside of an Apple Watch looks like, check the photos.I purchased this item May 2019, 5 months later and I’m in a pool with the watch in water mode and after 5 minutes the watch stops responding. I had just charged it but thought maybe not enough and it could be dead.After my swim I put it to charge and after an hour, no response. I wait for it to dry thinking maybe SOMEHOW there was water damage, no response.After 24 hours, charged and dry there is still no response. But magically the watch pops open. POPS. It didn’t fall on a hard surface. I didn’t smash it out of frustration. It just POPPED open while sitting on my night stand.5 months. It only took 5 months.It was great when it was working but definitely NOT GREAT when it breaks after JUST 5 months.I DO NOT recommend this product.",1,23
So far so good!,"This is my first Apple Watch, I’ve always wanted to get one and this was extremely easy to pair to my phone and to download apps on. I use it for tracking my food intake and my workouts as well as my sleep and it’s been really great! The first day I used it the battery didn’t last long but after the next couple charges it’s lasted about 2 days without needing a charge. So far I’m pretty happy with it but I’ll be keeping my eye out on how long the battery lasts me over time. If you’re looking to save some extra money while still getting a lot of the same features I would recommend this watch! So far I’m very happy with my purchase!",5,23
Better than the Series 4,"So I bought this watch around the time I got the iPhone XR and 3 months later, it is still pristine! I get 2 day battery with no charge and even helps me monitor my exercise. I lost 3,000 calories in 3 months! I bought the series 3 instead of 4 because for me, there is not preferable difference to spend an extra $200. I’d recommend this instead of the 4 any day of 2018/2019",5,23
Great Apple Watch for low price,"I went with this Apple Watch because the newer series are just so expensive. I can say that this watch is great for anyone looking to get an apple device. It is still fast and up to date with all the main features of other apple watches. and the battery lasts for a full day in my experience. However, if you are looking to use ECG features you should get a newer apple watch as this one does not have that feature. Also, it has a limited number of watch faces compared to the newer versions, but that is not that big of a deal. Other than that, if you are just looking for a watch for tracking fitness and checking notifications, this is a great option.",5,23
Defective,Didn’t connect to my I phone I was probably sent a defective one,1,23
Defective,Do NOT buy this watch from Amazon right now. As you can see from recent reviews they must have received a defective batch from Apple. The watch does not pair to the phone not matter what. You’ll have to take it to Apple to have them look at it and they’ll end up sending it to a repair center. Save your time and buy directly from Apple.,1,23
Pairing Issues,"Ordered this watch to replace my Gen 1 Apple Watch.I had the most difficult time trying to get this watch paired to my iPhone XR.It would initially pair and then it would disconnect with the Pairing Failed message.Even speaking with Amazon support as well as Apple directly, it would not pair and stay paired.Even tried multiple iPhones.My Gen 1 would pair again to my phone without issues.Even when Apple Support gave up, I continued my attempts trying to get it to pair.Finally, I was able to get it to perform the Apple Watch update and it stayed paired.",3,24
It is outdated for 2020,"Apple now makes a series 5, which is newer.I bought this as a gift because the receipient uses the Apple ecosystem.In my opinion there are better non-Apple watches out there at a much better value (price.)I think the Samsung Galaxy Gear is much better than this watch.The Gear S3 came out in 2016 and the Apple Watch 3 came out in 2017.Apple seems to be a few steps behind the cutting edge for many years now.",3,24
Time With this watch will change your life,This is by far one of the best watches~smart watches I have encounter. This keeps track of my sleeping my breathing and my heart on my Activity my learning everything you can imagine and it also tells time and if you have Mickey or Minnie they will even speak to you the time it even works with my Alexa. A must have Watch oh and did I mention that tells you when I need to drink some water or take my medicine is my own personal assistant I am Loving it and living the big life. Glad this before it’s too late you’ll never regret it!,5,24
Good Value and Useful Device,"This little watch is awesome. Although it doesn’t have the cellular connection, I’m usually within arms length of my phone. It’s been a great notification tool, and I use it for navigation as well. The heart rate monitor is pretty accurate too, although during HIIT workouts the sensor kind of freaks out due to so much movement. All in all I’d recommend this watch. It’s a great value.",5,24
What time is it?,"I've been a FitBit and Garmin user for so many years. When Apple was having a sale on their watches, I had to finally invest and try this out. I'm in love! The series 3 gives me so much when connecting with life & sport. I do not have a separate plan for it so I have to have my phone with me if I go out for a walk or whatever. I like the activity rings that slowly close throughout the day and the reminder to get up and move. I also like being able to get/send texts and phone calls (phone must be nearby). Lastly, I love that it's waterproof and can wear it in the pool.",5,24
Phenomenal I love it got so my compliments already!,I love it brand new right out of the box very easy to set up in a heart beat it’s remarkable and at this price your getting your money’s worth hands down it’s brand new right out of the box don’t listen to the negativity trust me it’s all legitimate you will love it as we all do!! Get it now like today if your getting this series 3 watch you will not find a better price anywhere!!,5,24
Doesn’t work properly,"The screen on the watch does not work properly. It doesn’t let me touch to select widgets/apps consistently. It doesn’t slide the notifications down appropriately (will get “stuck” half way down the screen). When I select and app or widget and it DOES open up, the screen will immediately go black and back to the home when I “wake” it. It does not consistently wake when the crown is pushed or when I turn my wrist up. I’ve updated it, restarted both the watch and phone and tried messing with settings. I’m super disappointed.",1,24
"Has major glitch , buyer beware",Has major glitch ..Apple is aware of theproblem.. doesn’t mirror your phone like advertised.. they say their working on it..it’s been months now.. and still not fixed..they say just wait till the ne next update ..so.. you buy a new watch and they know it doesn’t work? Yet they continue to sell them?Very disappointed in Apple..I was a fan u til now..even after a replacement they sent.. it still doesn’t work..and the bad thing is... they know about it..poor business practice .. greedy!Now I’m stuck with a watch that doesn’t work properly ...hope this helps..don’t waste your money on this model !,1,24
"Fragile product, not worth to pay","Bought the series 3, 42mm, to replace my Garmin forerunner used to practice outside activities. Completely disappointed with the product as it's a very fragile watch. In less than a week of use glass was broken due to a very soft impact during an outside running. If you're looking for a watch to practice outside sports I would definitely not recommend it. I'm a fan of apple products and the product seems to work fine as a smart watch but not fit for sports purposes...Apple authorized services do not change the glass, you have to pay a high value, very close to a new watch to change your watch, totally unacceptable!",1,24
Happy girl,"4/10/20 the watch arrived on schedule and in perfect condition. It’s an Apple Watch, so it was in its classic white box with apple logo and plastic seal, brand new. I have iPhone 11 Pro Max and it paired with ease in less than 10 minutes. I want to say less than five. I’m adding this detail because this is what scared me: I saw a review saying it took 30 minutes. I saw some reviews saying it didn’t even pair. Lucky for me, that didn’t happen. So far no complaints. I am loving my new watch. Will update with more deets. 4/15 battery life is legit, I get two days or more out of mine and that’s a serious upgrade because my old smart watch wouldn’t last a whole day. I love this thing! Buy it already!",5,24
A Huge Step Up from Fitbit HR,"Love this watch - I enjoy receiving notifications of texts that come through - very handy.I also love the apps that I can access on my watch (and my iPhone)Love the slideshow feature.Next time I need a fitness tracker, I may step up another level to the 4, with its bigger face.I do wish that this watch would hold a charge for more than a day, but it recharges so quickly - I just like to always have it on me wrist....I tried this watch when my third fitbit in 4 years stopped working.I will never go back to Fitbit.",5,25
Better than expected! So many features and uses!,I love this watch! I am not usually a watch person but I had to try it. I can’t believe how comfortable and useful it is. I got it mostly for the health app. I have been tracking my work outs and steps but it comes in handy when I can’t find my phone (usually everyday lol). It also help me not have to pick up my phone every time I get a notification. I can set up only the most important notifications like calls and texts so I am not checking my phone all day. The Hey Siri helps me remember things when I can’t add it to my calendar or notes manually. I can’t say enough about how it has helped me.,5,25
"No regrets, Best Buy yet!","I am absolutely obsessed with my Apple Watch. So many people told me that wasn’t a good investment, that I wouldn’t use it often, but I feel completely opposite of what they told me. I love being able to leave my phone in the bedroom to charge and the ability to be in my kitchen cooking dinner and responding to texts, Emails, and being able to see who’s calling me. There are so many features that I did not realize would come with the watch including the ability to use several apps. I would recommend this product to anybody who’s looking for a smart watch with many many capabilities.",5,25
Received 2 within a week neither would pair.....,"Ordered one would not pair with either of our iphones, called Apple and they could not figure it out. Received the replacement same thing.......got my $$$$ back. Time to move on! Thinking that Amazon has a bad batch???Update: Ordered one from Walmart (same price 199.00) paired up fine!",1,25
Your going to break it and be sad.,"So I love, love this watch. I love the app, I love it, however if you are alive and do anything wearing this watch you better wrap it in bubble wrap. I had this watch for 50 days- 50 DAYS! It is dead. I bought it to replace a fit bit for fitness tracking and was so happy with it and then the screen got cracked and then water got in it and then it was fried. I passed on Apple care thinking for 200 bucks if I get a year I will be happy. Besides even with Apple Care it would have been 50 bucks for AC and the another 80 bucks to replace/fix. I have loved Apple products but honestly after one to many cracked screens (iPhones) I’m done. I loved this watch. I’m sad it’s dead. I want another one, but i’m going to be strong.",1,25
A great substitute for the series 5 at a great price,"I couldn't justify dropping money on a new series 5, which only has a few new features. The series 3 is perfect if you're on a budget, but still want the benefits of having an Apple watch.",5,25
Defect,"Got it. Had it for an hour, and I was on apple support for 3 hours. I had to send it out because it was not pairing to my iphone, and I am super unsatisfied with this purchase.",1,25
<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>,Artículo corresponde a su descripción y llego en el tiempo esperado,5,25
Absolutely love this Apple Watch.A+++,"Wanted an Apple Watch so much but didn’t want to spend the money for the 5.This is excellent.My friend has the 5 and so far mine does exactly the same as hers, guess it’s the fun yes we need. Watch is smaller and thicker, but I have small wrist so looks great. Bought multi color covers and mesh metal bands, so I can change up the look from working out to office.And price was best I found. Tracks my work outs, steps, elliptical, and sleep patterns .So happy I purchased!!",5,25
She loves it,Works great I got this for my wife one because she loves apple and has an iPhone to go with it and two because she has leukemia and needed a fast easy way to keep track of her heart rate day and night step count ext she loves it and only takes it off to charge it last her about 2 days before needing to charge saying that she dose not play games or text on her watch so that helps with the battery life,5,25
Dream comes true,Really love the features and appearance of this Apple Watch 3 series It is oneexcellent watch to have when you have a budget to spend on wishes.Well worth the money. Battery life is decent very smooth touch screen and advance software and beautiful hardware. All apps works so well. If thinking about spending the money on a smartwatch this is a must cop. It’s one lavish style on my wrist. Really loving it.,5,26
Battery life was a deal breaker,"I really wanted to like this watch. The design is great. I also own many Apple products which I love. I read many reviews but not many ever spoke about the battery life. 18 hours is not long enough given my previous smart watch, Fitbit Versa, lasted 5+ days. Which did most of what the Apple Watch does. You cannot go on an overnight camping trip without charging it. Or any weekend getaway without bringing another charging cable. Minor but annoying. Most reviews said they charged it at night. However, I wanted to track my sleep and heart rate while I slept. If I wanted to track sleep I had to download yet another App and most of the time pay for it. Which leads to yet another app on my phone taking up space. Unfortunately I returned it. My first Apple product that was disappointing. I am more in the market for a fitness watch. An all in one as regards to the App. No extra apps on my phone to track things. Apple Watch seemed more like my phone on my wrist that took more space on my phone with the numerous apps I needed or wanted.",2,26
Doesn't track steps accurately,"I really want to love my new apple watch, however, the steps aren't tracking correctly and I've done everything I've read and been told to do and still it's not working right.We went to Sea World and my daughter has a $40 watch and her steps were more accurate than my $200 watch!We walked all day long and I ended the day with around 550 steps and she had over 10,000 steps.At this point, I'm not sure what to do since my return window passed with Amazon.",2,26
Not using sleep tracking because it needs charge during the night.,It's not useful for sleep tracking if it doesn't have a good battery life. Unfortunately that's been my experience is that I end up charging this thing during the night so i can keep it going during the day. Also my dog loves sleeping on it. It might benefit from charging quicker? The mobile app is decent but there's room for improvement for how much I'm spending on it.,1,26
Good for budget,"Since everyone knows Apple doesn’t really have any sales that often, I looked to 3rd party sellers such as Best Buy and amazon to see if I can get this for any less that the average price. And I was surprised because here on amazon they do have sales often!The watch itself turned out great, kind of what you should expect with an Apple product. Their ecosystem is pretty nice and this pairs perfectly and seemlessly to your iPhone. Make sure that if you are willing to buy an Apple Watch, you get it for more than just the time. It’s a luxury product and helps makes smaller tasks/notifications easier to manage and simpler at times. Great purchase.It also comes with a larger band inside as well!",5,26
Best decision ever!,"I upgraded my classic watch to an apple watch and the experience has been totally amazing. Since I have a small wrist the Series 4 watch seems to big for it, but the 38mm Series 3 is totally perfect. I have a GPS enabled Series 3 and it is perfect with Siri, detecting movements and workout tracking. I totally love the white color as it can be paired with different band colors. Some people have a question that apple doesn’t sell 38mm bands anymore, but let me tell you that the 40mm bands go perfectly well with the 38mm series 3 watch. I charge my watch once in 2 days and it works perfectly fine. I totally love this purchase.",5,26
Great purchase! Love it!,"Got the 38mm series 3 Apple Watch. Love it! Perfect size. Battery life is really great. I don’t need to charge it every night but I usually do anyways. Set up was super easy and automatically synced up with my iPhone, then was able to choose which apps to put on the watch. So far I love it! I’ve heard from friends that this is the best Apple Watch out for the money (as of 09/2020). Highly recommend.",5,26
Unuseable,Product came and it is locked without someone else’s Apple ID. I cannot use the product at all.,1,26
We love our watches,"I had bought one for myself last month after my husband received a smart watch as a gift. His was not an Apple and it had some nice features, but it would only hold a charge for about eight hours and he was getting frustrated. Also we swim every day and I am able to wear mine in the pool and he couldn’t. His birthday is in few weeks so I wanted to surprise him with an Apple Watch. He was very surprised and very happy.We both love our watches. We are in our seventies and had never had smart watches before now. It was a challenge setting them up but we did it!!",5,26
Very Impressed,I was skeptical about buying an Apple Watch from Amazon but I am glad that I did. It was packaged just like it came from the apple store. The battery life is great. I am in love with my new watch. I waited a couple of months before completing a review.,5,26
"Its what you don't know, that wastes your time and $$","I only turned the watch on and off and after reading the sparse written material that came with the watch (which was difficult to read becuase it is in grey color print, which is the worse print color to use as its really hard for older people to be able to see), it says you need to sync it with your iphone. I have an android, not an iphone. Otherwise you do not get all the features. Since I do not have an iphone I am returning the watch without ever using it. Wish somewhere in the descriptionit would be highlighted ""Must have an iphone to use all features of this watch"".If I had seen that, I would not have purchased it.",1,27
Just works.....,"Another stellar product by apple. I have had other smart watches and they just don't work the way you think they should. This watch does everything I need it to do and more. It connects flawlessly with my other apple devices (iPhone, MacBook. etc). The band is very easy to put on and take off. The charging port is very easy to use with the magnet. Most importantly the activity tracker has already helped keep me motived to move more and do better with my health. I would recommend this smart watch to anyone.",5,27
Received a defective watch,Received a defective watch the touch screen did not work properly nor did the raise arm to speak feature.an agent setup up to have a replacement watch sent to me that was supposed be delivered today and pick up the defective watch I was told that the replacement watch was lost stolen while en route and the agent who I filed the initial claim with did not process a pick up correctly. I never seen such utter bad customer service.,1,27
More Than a Watch,"Sure it tells time and you can change the watch faces, but the main draw was helping me with my fitness and for being a convenient method of using my phone without touching it.An entire day's worth of use only uses about 25 % of the charge, but perhaps it's because I don't stare at its screen all day.Makes it all the better that I didn't spend for the Series 5 as it would be doing just as little as the significantly cheaper Series 3.",5,27
short battery life but not horrible,"I’ve had mine for a month and have almost no complaints. The battery life leaves something to be desired but not a big deal. Amazon said it wouldn’t arrive with a charger so I bought an additional one...turns out it came with one in the box so I have 2. Again, not a big deal, just a minor annoyance. Especially considering Apple loves to change the USBs so I can’t plug either charger into my laptop",5,27
"Decent fitness tracker, better smart watch","Overall, it’s an okay fitness tracker. I chose it over the top Fitbit because this watch supported Audible and it was more of a smart watch.I like it for being able to take calls while exercising. It’s just okay from a battery life perspective. For sleep tracking, I still use my basic Fitbit.",5,27
Buy a Fitbit or a Samsung!,"This thing is complete trash and will be sent back tomorrow! My Fitbit Alta never had problems tracking anything. According to this piece of junk I’m dead at night bc I have NO HEARTBEAT. I’m going to give Apple a shot and spend half my day at the Apple store bc their tech support has no clue why it’s not tracking sleep at all. Heart rate is every 30 mins at best during waking hours, battery has 24hours of life at the most. Worst purchase I’ve ever made!",1,27
Good Surprise,I received my Apple Watch 38mm today. It came newly sealed in plastic still. I was so excited to open it and put it on right away. Calling from this thing is very clear and easy. Texting is also pretty easy. And it fits nicely. I can’t wait to use it for the active part of my life.,5,27
Apple Watch Series 3,I bought the Apple Watch Series 3 for my daughter.She is so extremely happy with this thing.It looks great and works just as great.It was easy to set up and I think my daughter likes it better than anything else she has.The item was fairly priced right and shipped quickly.,5,27
Very good Prime Day deal!,This was a great buy on Prime Day! I got mine ordered and checked a few hours later and they were sold out! This is a brand new Series 3 Apple Watch. It comes in the Apple box and has everything except the adapter for the charging cable as others have noted. The charger has a USB connector and we have several Apple chargers so just used one of them. The watch charge is very good. I turn the display off and when I lift my arm to look at it. I think that helps. So many apps! I had a couple of gift cards so that made it even more of a good buy! Very satisfied!,5,27
Best Value for the Money for an Apple Watch !,"If you want to give the Apple Watch a try to see if it will work for you, this is by far the best value for the money. I have the latest edition at 44mm as well and was thinking that this screen might be too small but surprisingly it is not! It is also very clear and easy to read .. my like my larger watch! So if the smaller version fits your wrist better, don't worry too much about the screen size in my experience / imo at least.",5,28
Keeping me on time and on track!,I finally broke down and bought the apple watch now that the Series 3 is down to $199 (just can't bring myself to spend much more than that!). I didn't expect to love it as much as I do. The battery lasts all day which is key. It's making me more aware of my activity and inspires me to meet my daily goals. I love getting texts and easily answering them from the watch. Years ago I had a fitbit that just counted steps - this watch wasn't much more expensive and it has so many more features.,5,28
I love this watch!,"I love this watch! My husband got me this for an anniversary and I’ve worn it every day since. I have a rapid heart beat so its nice to always know what my heart rate is at the exact moment and I feel that I exercise and try to reach my goals a lot more now too. It also tracks steps for Pokémon go, if you are a fellow player. I don’t wear it at night because I find it uncomfortable, but I keep it on all day and it gets the job done very well!",4,28
Buyer Beware... Not Compatible with iPhone 6,"Received the watch and super excited to get it up and running. It has to pair with your iPhone to work. Ok, no big deal. WELL... it's not compatible with the iPhone 6 or earlier iPhone models. Apple says I have to buy a new iPhone if I want to use the watch. What?!? My iPhone is perfectly fine and I am not looking to upgrade before 5G model comes out. So my watch is currently useless unless I spend another $600 or more for a newer iPhone. There is no way around this.",1,28
It’s alright,I love these watches but if you do not buy a good cover for them they are easily cracked over the stupidest thing. This is my third watch and will be last. This time bought a good cover. Also battery life last about one day that’s it for me and I don’t even use it much but for time.,3,28
Would recommend Apple Watches for sure!,"I love my watch. The sleep tracking never would work on mine but I have decided to charge it at night instead so it works out. I really love being able to see my texts & respond to them without my phone, I love being able to ping my phone when I don’t know where my phone is from my watch, I LOVE the workout & activity tracker, it helps keep me motivated to workout + move throughout the day. I love getting reminders on my watch from Siri that I have set & I love checking the weather real quick on my wrist. Over all, would seriously recommend. I was against the thought of them for a while because I spent so much money to purchase my phone, but it truly enhances my use of my phone & allows me to not be consumed by my phone. I love my Apple Watch!!!!! Everyone should get one if they are considering it. SO HELPFUL. Also, the space grey is so nice, never looks dirty.",5,28
Very fragile!,"As soon as you turn it on and get it close to your iPhone, it’s being pared (amazingly easy).Fully compatible with my iPhone 8.Good battery life (it lasts for two days and I am a heavy user).Great features of heart rate monitor and sports tracker.I liked it a lot until it fell ONE time and that was enough for the screen to crack :(In such an expensive device, I would expect to have a more durable screen that can absorb a short fall.",2,28
Poor Battery Life/No Charger Head,"It was nice that this was priced well and was delivered the same day. However, upon opening the package I noticed it was packaged differently than how apple packages it. I also discovered the charger head was missing. Series 3 watches come with the charger head-this one does not. The USB cable is included though. After one day of wearing the watch, I noticed the battery drains really fast! I didn’t even use the watch-took it off the charging dock and set it on the nightstand and it dropped 25% battery life in the course of 2 hours!!!I am not super happy with this product.",3,28
Surpassed my expectations,"Great watch, better price. After looking at all options available, series 3 is perfect and there is no need for a brand new and ridiculously priced watch. Packaging was pristine, arrived earlier than anticipated, and my watch looks and works beautifully. I have no complaints and I am very satisfied with this purchase.",5,28
Love it!,Love it!!!! I finally had to upgrade from the Apple 1 due to the battery life and I am so happy I did! I love the workout sensor because half the time I get all excited and start running and forget to track it.I also like that it has the water lockout as well to allow me to swim with it. It is faster than my Apple 1 and looks really good.Great price for someone who doesn’t need the latest and greatest- Just something that works well.,5,28
5 stars and my apologies to the seller!!,5 stars for the seller. It arrived quickly and was genuine and brand new! I have an old phone though and it wouldn’t work so I had to send it back and that process was smooth as well!,5,29
NOW I understand the craze,"I was always one to criticize the Apple Watch, that was until I finally got one for myself. My primary purpose for getting the watch was to help motivate myself to exercise more and keep myself on track and this watch has helped me do just that! I can track so many different forms of exercise and I love how I can pause workouts, track calories, and have the data also tracked on my phone. The watch also gives me reminders throughout the day to work towards completing my circles (the standing notifications DO get a little annoying when I'm doing work though, not gonna lie). I also love how I'm able to track my heartrate through my sleep and see my sleep patterns (do note that you will have to do this through a third party app). If you're on the fence about this watch, get it!!",5,29
reaction to the watch band,Got hives around both wrists from the sport band. been trying to deal with Apple regarding this. I had to spend another $50 to buy a band that's nothing more than a piece of velcro with a Nike insignia on it.I want Apple to refund the cost of the original sport band which is $50 since It's useless to me.Went through an entire interview of questions regarding the reaction tothe band. I was asked to upload photos of the band and my reaction.Told I would get a call within 4 hours of uploading photos. That was 4 days ago.Endless time again today wasted on the phone and online chat to keep being told someone will call.They give a specific time too and no one does.$50 is all I asked for from a corp. that has billions.Done with Apple.Keep your products.I will not remain loyal to liars.,1,29
"Battery life sucks, but it’s a good watch","So this is my first Apple Watch. I’m into body building and will be starting my bulking diet November 1st. I got it solely for the calorie tracker. Which I really like. I also like that if my phone is near, I can answer calls on my watch; and use speak to text. BUT the battery life does suck. However, being my first Apple Watch, I couldn’t bring myself to spend the money on the 6 series. For the money, I think it’s a good investment for someone who has never had one.",5,29
Get it while it’s cheap,"This watch is a must have for the new price, it wasn’t worth it at first because it was to expensive but now with cheaper price it’s a go getter.It’s comfortable and easy to use but I don’t need to explain no more it’s a Apple product most of them are good",5,29
Super excited,"*UPDATE* MUST HAVE . I’m inlove with this watch especially working in healthcare i no longer have to pull my phone out , it’s convenient , the health tracking apps are amazing . Glad I made this purchase ***Ordered Friday Received it today (Sunday) as stated . So far so good no damages to packaging , no damages to device , it’s brand new in box with everything included . Even an extra band . Only complaint is I received a black one when I ordered white . But that’s a simple fix by purchasing additional bands .I’m super excited to use it especially since I’ve always wanted to own a Apple Watch .The price was worth it !!!!!",4,29
Battery life last long time!,"So happy with this purchase!Especially for the price. I work in the plant and we’re not supposed to have her phones,this works perfect if my phone is put up I can still tell if I have a phone call or text messages from my sons sitter.I decided to purchase this when I missed a call from his sitter stating that she thought he broke his arm. I checked my phone later on and got a voicemail. So that’s when I decided I needed to get a smart watch And this one is perfect!",5,29
Love it (38mm),This is my first Apple Watch and didn’t want to start with the most recent so I started with the series 3 obviously. First off I love it. Set up was quick and easy. The watch came witha full charge. It took me some getting use to since it was my first watch but once you get the hang of it it’s smooth sailing. I will use this watch everyday. And FYI I wasn’t a person to wear watches but the series 3 is so comfortable I don’t even notice I’m wearing it.,5,29
Buy from apple directly or even best buy,"Band does not securely lock anymore and it only has been worn for once month.Amazon customer service cannot do anything for me since I missed the return window. Only suggestion was to ""kindly reach out to the manufacturer."" Something like this should be PURCHASED FROM APPLE directly or maybe BUY FROM BEST BUY INSTEAD.I say this because at least they can provide more support than Amazon will for products like this.Amazon customer service is usually great... but not this time.",1,29
BETTER THAN I THOUGHT!,"I put off getting the apple watch for a couple of years thinking it wouldn't be ""all that"". I recently bought the fitbit versa that was all the rage at Christmas. It was hailed as better than the apple watch by some. Obviously those people never had an apple watch. The fitbit quit on me after a month so I went ahead and got the apple series 3 watch.It is in a whole different league than the fitbit versa and I paid almost the same for the apple watch as the fitbit. This watch is amazing!",5,29
Highly recommend,"I think this is a great product. That package wasn’t damaged which was nice. The function of the watch if efficient and smooth. The set up took a few minutes which is fine, just be patient. I think it’s great. My only hiccup, is the battery life. Used it for a day and I was already done to 50%. I don’t want to blow that battery. But overall I’m very happy with it and how I’m able to mirror my phone with using the apps. I think it’s great! Highly recommend!!",5,30
Awesome product,"I updated from the series 1 watch finally.I was gonna buy this item directly from Apple, but then I saw that Amazon had this on sale for Father's Day.I received my watch quickly.It was easy to set up and while the downside is waiting for it to update.Well I found other things to do for the half hour or so that it took.The battery lasts about 2 days of regular use.I tend to charge it in the mornings to about 70-80 percent and it'll last me till the next day no problem.",5,30
Better than my r——x,"I hesitated but I really like this cool watch.It has different options for the face, stopwatch, timer, quiet vibes, tells me when to stand, move around, and breathe!Comfortable, etc. so what if it is spying on every move I make?",5,30
"Neat, sleak and does what its supposed to","My only compalint about it is that it sometimes doenst sync up with phone regardign how many unread messages there are. I look at messages on phone and read them, but on the watch sometimes shows that they are still unread. WHich is annoying and i dont know how to fix. The watch itself works good and looks nice. I bought a metal band for it but only use the one it came with. It's alot more comfy.",4,30
Great deal!,"Decided to upgrade from FitBit to Apple Watch and caught a great deal of the Apple Watch Series 3.I found it easy to set up and get to tracking. I did have to read up on how to use the buttons and all at first, but caught on easily.Love being able to access my Apps on the watch if the phone is not right by me.Got the smaller case, but it is still easy to ready and do things on.Just got it, so no ratings yet for the battery life, or water resistance.Still learning and playing around with the watch face and settings.",5,30
Excellent Watch,"The battery last me about 2 days. It charges very quickly too. I wear it in the shower every day and it doesn’t cause any issues. Do take it off if you’re going to be in a dusty environment, I had to send my first one back after the microphone got filled with paint dust that I could not remove!!",5,30
sos far it has not given me any issues,"So far it hasn't given me any issues. I like the size it is perfect for my wrist. It is sleek and elegant as is. I haven't had it for a long time so in terms of durability or technical issues, I haven't had any so far so i cant say.",5,30
Long battery Life!,"I didn't need anything too fancy, just something to prevent me from having to take out my GIANT phone all the time. (especially at work) when someone texts me, I can simply look at my phone and get back to them.It's also compatible with other messager apps like facebook messenger and Discord. Also a great way to track your workouts!",5,30
Obsolete- Cannot handle latest upgrade,I am SO Disappointed. I Purchased this watch thinking that it would at least last me for a year or maybe two. But the watch only has 4.8GB’s. And after just one software upgrade I no longer have enough room the the latest upgrade. I only had it for two months and it is already on the road to being obsolete.,1,30
Great buy,"Great watch, very comfortable and size was perfect.Have had fitbit blaze last two years and this apple watch takes the cake. It looks and feels like a nice watch, very happy with the purchase.Like others I was skeptical to purchase on Amazon but it came brand new, un-opened package and in apple packaging.I would highly recommend the purchase if your looking, you won’t be disappointed.",5,30
Perfect Gift,"This Apple Watch was a gift to my wife and she loved it. It’s a perfect gift for anyone but the only thing I did not like is that charging takes a while and also activity option is little bit confusing. Otherwise, great watch.",4,31
Apple Watch 3 only compatible with iPhone 6s or later,"My low rating is based on a woeful lack of information in the product specs. I bought the Apple Watch 3 and could not pair it with my iPhone 6 — because apparently, the new watch OS6 is only compatible with iPhone 6S and later. The specs and description do not say that. Only later did I see a mention of this deep in the Q&As. So now I have a watch in a box, until I can upgrade to a newer iPhone.",1,31
the best investment series 3,"I think series 3 display is much better (sharp and cute) than newer ones.battery life is pretty good more than 2 days. magnetic charging is so easy.watch is not slow at all, display is so cute and vivid, not dim at all.all functions are just working nicely after updating os to the latest.always on display is not necessary because just one finger tip touch will wake up the watch.watch is a watch. it is not a ipad.don't spend extra $200 money if you are not necessary for the newest health feature over series 5.",5,31
Alright not great,Not sure why but it breaks out my wrists . I have to alternate wrists to keep them less irritated. For that much money it should be real silver .I do like most of the apps but not sure about the accuracy of the sleep and steps . Seems off to me .,3,31
Worth the money,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. It is an amazing product and makes a terrific gift!,5,31
Glad I purchased,I loved this watch! I love it basically connected itself and I didn’t have to do much. Love I can have my own photo as watchface. I can answer calls make calls and text. Change music listen to music and lobe the wallow talkie function. Worth the money I’m very happy,5,31
Great Watch,"As with just about anything Apple, it's a great product. I loved this watch so much but I upgraded.",5,31
Buyer Beware: Software issues,"I bought the series 3 Apple watch to replace a Fitbit Alta HR that just stopped working.When I received the Apple watch, it will not pair with my IPhone 6 because the software that's pre-loaded in the watch is further along than what's possible in the IPhone 6.While the watch is compatible with the 6, I either have to make an appointment at the nearest Apple store which is over an hour away and not available after 5 PM or mail in my brand new watch to Apple so they can set the software back where it needs to be to pair with my phone.It takes 3-5 days to receive the mail-in materials and another 3-5 days for them to repair it and who knows how long to send it back to me.I could have ordered a new Fitbit for less money and had it working today.I'm frustrated that Apple doesn't make even their own products compatible with each other and they force you to spend ridiculous amounts of money on the latest and ""greatest"" in order to use their products.",3,31
Hacked Account Sale,"This item was illegally purchased by and sent to unknown persons at200 TOWN VWCANYON LAKE, TX 78133-6967",1,31
Watch out (pun intended) the description may be misleading,"I purchased this as a Christmas present thinking it was loaded with watchOS 5 as listed in the description.Unfortunately, the watch will not pair with the iPhone 6+ that the recipient has, despite my checking beforehand.I guess the watch i got was loaded with watchOS 6 which dropped support for ios 12.Disappointing Christmas.Now I have a watch that won't pair with anything.",2,31
Send quick replies through Watch,"I wasn't sure whether to purchase the 38mm or the 42mm. It was a gift for my sister who has a fat wrist. The 38mm was a good fit, the bigger one probably would've been better as far as screen size. Regardless, the watch works great. What stands out the most to me is the capability of replying to messages through the watch. My sister is a college student taking many classes, and the watch allows her to send a quick text without using her phone. I recommend this watch for any college or high school student. The price can't be beaten!",5,32
Screen Blank out after 3 months,"When I got the watch in March and set it up work great. Notice in the third month the screen would go dark with no reason. I mainly wear my watch when I exercise and taking a swim. At the end of the third month, the watch blank out and the screen hazy (like when you watching a movie and it lose its signal). It came back on twice and then never came back on. Really disappointed since to send it back where I am in the Caribbean is too expensive. Hoping I can trade it in when I travel later this year to Canada!",1,32
Bought it on a whim and I love it,"Bought the 38mm because I have a small wrist, and also separately purchased a scrunchie band from Amazon. I mainly use it so far for exercise tracking, but I love seeing my notifications on my watch. Privacy and battery life are great so far, charged it once, slept with it on, and it still had 30% before I went to bed the next night. Wouldn't recommend for people with poor eyesight, as the apps are small and I'm not sure if they can be made larger.",5,32
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!,This watch is PERFECT I LOVE IT!!! I will be purchasing this again for my daughter. The box it came in was perfect. The watch itself has no blemishes it is in perfect condition. The watch apps work perfect. The charger works perfect. My watch lasted about 2 days on one charge!! I definitely recommend!,5,32
Love!,"I am really happy with my purchase, I have been wanting an Apple watch for awhile and this was the best price I have seen for Series 3 in months! There was nothing wrong with it when I first received the product and it was easy to set up. Battery life could be better but I just put it on the charge before bed.",5,32
"Love my Apple Watch, series 3 GPS only","I love my Apple Watch. It’s so convenient when driving or doing something that requires not using your cell phone. I am an in-home care giver and this watch makes communication with family so much easier while on the job & driving from house to house. Not to mention the battery life, seems to last literally all day and than some. I highly recommend. And somehow when my phone dies, it’ll still let me receive messages and stuff from it when I only have the GPS watch.. and I’m definitely not complaining about it lol.",5,32
Makes the IPhone much better,"My Apple 3 watch is fantastic compared to my Motorola 360 series 2 I’ve had for a few years. I didn’t realize till I got the Apple Watch just how poor the Motorola performed. I was never able to fully utilize all the functions due to the poor battery life, it was ever only good for about 8 to 10 hours on a charge.I’m able to use all the apps on my iPhone through my Apple Watch, I can use it all day and still have 83% battery life at bed time. And the The integration with my phone is just fantastic the way I can answer calls and send text and everything through the watch truly Amazing compared to the Motorola.",5,32
It’s a cool watch,"I’ve been on the fence with the Apple Watch for a very long time. I decided to pull the trigger because of the price. I don’t regret my purchase, but there’s not amazing about the watch. It is a very cool watch, but there isn’t a feature that impressed me. I used to have a basic Garmin, and it did a lot of the same features. Aside from the esthetics, and the pairing; the Apple Watch seems basic to me. Finally, the notifications are annoying.",4,32
love it! def must buy!,"Been wanting an apple watch for a very long time but didn't want to pay an outrageous price. with work i can't check my phone so i thought now would be the perfect time to take a chance &' get one. for the price, a brand new apple watch you can't beat it. i recently bought a band &' protective shell to go around cause the rubber band makes me sweat &' irritates my skin.Once i received it i was worried about scratches or maybe not even pairing to my phone cause you never know what can happen but it was perfect no problems whatsoever, took maybe 10 mins to pair &' it works great, it doesn't come with a wall adapter to the charger but i went &' bought one so i wasn't worried. very very happy with my purchase &' have no regrets. it's def must buy!",5,32
It's a change from Fitbit if you want live step counts,"It's good for the basics but I'm sad that all the new watch faces are not available on this, only for the 5 model. However it's working fine for texting which is the main reason I switched from Fitbit.One thing I don't like about the AW vs Fitbit is you don't have a live count or HR on the clock face. You can click on it to update but it doesn't update every second like the Fitbit does.",3,32
Fast delivery . Feels better than series 4.Cheaper in amazon and Apple plus care availability.,It’s perfect ! I owned the series 4 before and it rusted out right after the year warranty . This watch feels more durable that the series four and I do not miss what ever extra feature was there - I think and ecg tracker . This was great but . If you go on coverage. apple.com you can purchase the Apple plus care if you don’t purchase the same time on amazon .I am very happy with this watch,5,33
Muy practico,Muy buen producto.Muy practico.,4,33
100% recommend this great watch!,"Love my Apple Watch, it’s everything you didn’t know you needed.So many different color and style bands are available to personalize the watch to your own style.Battery lasts about a day which is not as long as other watches, but if you think about it, we charge our phones every night...also takes less than an hour to fully charge.Also love the button to ping your phone when you lose it, very helpful.Super great watch, when this one breaks or dies, which I’m sure won’t be for a long while, I will be buying another one.",5,33
CAN NOT set up with CELLULAR providers,I didn't know this when purchased. Returned. I was hoping to see missed calls and new texts. You can NOT with this watch. I have iPhone 11 ProMax. ATT provider. So In bought another one thru ATT -- 5 series.,2,33
My honest opinion...,"I still have my watch til this day... which is a year later! It still is working fine. I didn’t like it at first, but that was before I started going to the gym regularly. I’ve been using it like crazy and it helps me track my steps and everything. I would like to update to get a new watch but I don’t see a problem with this one tbh.",5,33
Wrists best friend,The sleep tracking I don’t really care about or have devoted anytime to. I’m sure you have to set it up. Other than that I love this watch. It’s like a little buddy and I don’t use it for much expect time or when I’m at work and can’t be on my phone. Other than that it’s a good buy and I’m happy,5,33
Love my Apple Watch,"I absolutely love my Apple Watch 3rd gen!It has a nice sleek appearance, it works very well, it tracks my steps and notifies me of messages, calls, emails and etc...My only complaint would have to be the band that this watch comes with, it’s not the best for taking to work if you have an active job... I switched out the band and am much happier!",4,33
The perfect watch,"The battery life on the watch three is amazing! I usually use it from 7 am-11pm. And so far it just takes 30% off the full charge, I use it often so the battery is great. It picks up my voice to text easily and there is no delay.I do have a small wrist and I ordered the the 38mm one, and it takes up most of the space of my wrist, so it’s a perfect size.For the price compared to the newer ones it does what it’s supposed to do and I like it.I also love it since I cannot have my phone out at work, I am able to check messages and respond all from my wrist quickly.I definitely recommend for anyone thinking of purchasing one, it will change your life!",5,33
Bought this as a gift,It is really nice.I think the battery life should be a little better but I understand that is what happens when apps are not closed.My friend doesn't mind charging it every couple of days.I got to play with the watch some and it is pretty great.Using it to answer his iPhone sounds pretty good too.,5,33
Great watch,"My Iwatch 2 got broken and I was looking for a new one. I was not about to spend the cost of a brand new one so I looked for a gen 3 and found this one. I love it, the watch works great and does more than the gen 2. I am not a fan of the new watch bands but that is something easily fixed with a few dollars.",5,33
Surprisingly good,"Shipping was surprisingly fast and the watch came w the packing all sealed and everything. Series 3 is great for people who wants to have an Apple Watch but don’t mind about having the up to date one. It does basically everything that the series 5 do w small differences. Everything I need to do : track activities, weather and check messages is more than enough for me. I just think that batterie could be a little better. I basically have to charge in the end of the day every day.",5,34
Very much recommend this!,"I love this thing!! I’ve been doing research on the Apple Watch for years! Finally decided to get one. I will put it this way... I don’t need an Apple Watch, but I can’t imagine myself without one now! It tracks my heart which is wonderful because I have a heartmurmur, It’s counts steps,syncs with my workout apps on my iPhone, and it unlocks my Mac. I bought the generation behind because it can do just as much as the new one for a smaller price. I definitely recommend this!!",5,34
Exactly what I wanted,LOVE IT had no idea it came with a small/medium band and a medium/large band <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>,5,34
Love my Apple Watch!,"I've been very happy with my Apple Watch! I mainly purchased it to help with tracking my exercise, and for quick communication/updates with text and email for work. It's been great in all needed aspects and more. I love how easy it is to use, the battery life is fantastic.",5,34
DEFINITELY WORTH IT *,"I BOUGHT THIS APPLE WATCH BECAUSE IT WAS GOING FOR A STEAL/GREAT PRICE.FIRST, I BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE IF THE APPLE WATCH WAS LEGIT AND 100% THEY WERE SO I ENDED BUYING MY MOTHER ONE. SHE LOVES IT. ALSO IF YOU’RE WONDERING BETWEEN THIS OR THE NEW SERIES 6, DEFINITELY SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS, THE FEATURES ON THE SERIES 6 IS NOT WORTH IT WHILE THE SERIES 3 IS STILL GREAT.",5,34
Deal of the day and what a deal it was!!,I am sooo happy with my purchase! I have been wanting an Apple Watch forever!! I receive Brads Deal alerts and I saw the deal for the watch and finally decided to treat myself and just get it! I absolutely LOVE IT!!! It is so easy to sync with your phone ! I was very impressed with how fast it syncs and how it is so easy to use! It has all the features of an I phone and more! Best deal ever!!!,5,34
More useful than you think,"Was fortunate enough to get this item with Black Friday pricing. Overall the watch is very useful for things such as time, weather, notifications, etc. I haven't had the chance to use it while working but can see how it will cut down on my phone utilization. If your regular watch is already around the same cost, might as well use this watch.Update: Used this watch daily for about 5 months now. I can say that is certainly has proved useful while at work. I am able to quickly and discretely check on any updates or information without using my phone. As someone who often cannot use their phone at work, this is extremely helpful and convenient. It has been great for quick replies to texts, checking stocks, activity level, etc.",5,34
Astounding watch,"I have loved the Apple Watch since its debut in 2015. But I could never bring myself to buy one. To me, it was like a really nice car. It looks really cool, but you don't need it. Then, it came to me. One day, as I was walking down the street in Downtown Boston, I realized that everybody I saw wearing an Apple Watch had a certain modern, tech savvy look about them. They were all very confident looking people. The watch made that person look intelligent. That is what made me purchasethis watch. And two years later, I still love it with my heart and soul.",5,34
No software! Will not work!,Received this watch yesterday and tried to pair it with my phone but it kept saying that pairing failed. I called apple support and they informed me this particular watch had no software in it. Very unhappy. Getting a return started was such a headache. So please save yourself the headache and do not order this item!!!,1,34
A must buy,"I received my watch a few days ago.. Came a day early which I am pleased about.. I’m not a BIG fan of watches.. but I workout and using my phone was just annoying when I listened to music connected to my airpods.. had to carry it on my pockets when I go for walks, workouts..but now that I BOUGHT the iWatch.. I have no REGRETS..so far so good! The screen protector that I have on my watch, isn’t included in the box (just saying).. but it does come with a charger that 100%. works AND an extra band.. was gonna buy the 42mm but decided to see how the 38mm will be on me first! The 38mm fits very perfectly.. I have a small hand so I can imagine how the 42mm would look like if I wore it<U+0001F602> I’ll keep it at 5 stares for now.. I’ll come back to update on my comment.. but other than that the iWatch itself is amazing!",5,34
Love it!,LOVEEEEE my watch! I haven’t had any issues with it at all and I wear it daily. I’ve worn it for 12+ hours at a time without it dying. Was in mint condition! Shipping took longer then it was supposed too so that was disappointing. I was leaving to go out of town and paid extra for it to be here before I left but it took longer to ship then it was supposed to. But very satisfied with the product itself.,5,35
Not Holding Up,"Less than 90 days old and I already have issues. The microphone doesn’t work (tried all the suggested steps several tines) and now Minnie won’t talk. Love the other functions of this watch but wonder what stops working next.Update- Still having issues. The face popped off while wearing it. Upon researching, I found this is common in the earlier series. Also found that Apple is aware but typically doesn’t cover repair. Took it to Apple and nope, they don’t cover this known defect. Instead they charge 159 to repair. Not worth it.",2,35
works very well,I am very satisfied with this watch! I had the series 2 before and then got a series 5. but returned because the series 3 works just fine and half of the price of 5. It works very well for tracking exercise and also for calls.,5,35
ONLY works with new iPhones,"I have an ipad pro, macbook pro, and an old iPhone so I mistakenly assumed the product would work considering how deep I already am as a customer.The device is a brick to the point you can't even access the main menu if you don't have a newer iphone. It won't let you go beyond set up without pairing. It does not let me sync my calendar or events or even connect to set up the watch from my ipad or mac. For a company that prides itself on it's ""ecosystem"" this is unforgivable. They expect you to pay over $500+ for a phone before you can even access to a $150-$400 standalone device it misleadingly markets itself as.Anything below a iphone 6s won't work further limiting this product's use. Why don't you allow users to access the base of your device and hide it behind a pay wall?Really disappointed and will be returning and looking at competitors.",1,35
Amazing purchase,"This watch is the best purchase I’ve made all year. I used to have a FitBit but now I can’t imagine going back. This watch has so many other features than the FitBit and it’s also waterproof! $200 may seem like a lot of money but when you’re getting a watch that pretty much does everything a phone can do, it’s way worth it! (I would recommend getting a screen protector because I’ve hit it against a few things and it can easily be scratched.)",5,35
Avoid this! Doesn’t work,"Don’t buy this!!!! Not accurate at all in anything. I’ll be sitting all day and it says my stand goal was met. I’ve been on the elliptical for 50 minutes as I type this and it says I’ve only done 7 minutes of exercise! I also have the ring on silent in the app, but my watch still rings loud in meetings. Wish I never bought this!!!!!!!! Pathetic.",1,35
Love it!,"I ordered me & my fiancé one! He works in landscaping & I’m a busy stay at home mom of 4 children. This watch is a life saver, I no longer have to have my phone in my hand when I’m busy cleaning, cooking etc. He loves his when he’s at work he can access what he needs without pulling his phone out. I also ordered the scene protectors & they are most definitely worth the money! The battery life is amazing but I did fully charge them when they came in before connecting to my phone. It’s literally all you need when you’re a busy person!",5,35
Nice watch,This purchase was for my daughter she is 14 and wanted one for her birthday. She has been very happy with it. It paired to her phone very easily we bought a screen protector to go on it to keep it looking great. The only thing that was a little disappointing is that even without a lot of use it sometimes can not make it through 24 hours without a charge so it makes it hard to track your sleep if you have to take it off to charge it. Now she just charges it while she showers if she wants to track her sleep.,5,35
my first apple watch!,"bought this as my first apple watch.I am really enjoying it.I also use it a lot to track my runs and I don't think it is quite as accurate as a Garmin though.Plus I like the web interface for Garmin, but I am exporting to Strava via the Health Fit app I bought, so they have a nice web interface.In general I like all the features and am happy.",5,35
Not a single regret,"I've been eyeing my coworkers watch for over six months now, and finally decided to take the plunge. ZERO regrets. This has been so great at work. I can check my messages real quick and manage my phone without whipping out of my pocket. My screen usage even went down 60%. It's freeing!My only sadness is not getting the cellular version, but I still have my Iphone 5, so that wasn't an option unless i was going to upgrade that as well.",5,35
Great motivator,Not very tech savvy but love this! Great motivator to work on health and fitness! Can’t stop looking at my wrist. I’m horrible about misplacing my phone so the “ping” feature really help!,5,36
Can’t use with iPad,"Please be aware that you cannot use the iPad with the iWatch. Other than that, it’s a solid item. Don’t skimp on the protective case.",5,36
After two month. I’m still wearing it.,"Been wearing it all the time since I’ve own it for about 2 months. I did get a skin irritation initially which lasted for about 2 weeks, and later went away. The battery life last for about 12-14 hours with moderate use. I’m happy with my purchase. I’ve also used it to find my phone many time, read messages when I driving. The news bulletins are also quite useful, the Alarm I use on a weekly bases, it has a vibrating option that wakes me no problem. It durability is good also. I haven’t broken it’s face yet, but I do have to be more conscious about that since it’s not a rugged sports watch. I may buy a cover for it for extra ruggedness down the line.",5,36
how could i not!,"easy set up, always told myself i would never get an apple watch because it was a waste of money and time... boy was i wrong! being a delivery driver i can’t always be on my phone so now everything is in a flick of the wrist! :)",5,36
"Don’t think twice, buy this iWatch!!","I absolutely love this watch. I wear it everyday and would be lost without it. I am a full leg amputee and have long periods that I am home alone. This watch is my safety net. If “I’ve fallen and can’t get up”, I just press the button o the side say who I’d like to call and Siri calls them for me. The calls come in and go out very clearly. I have been extremely happy with this purchase!",5,36
I was cheated,I ordered my watch and was soo happy to receive it…until I looked In the box… and the only thing that was in there … wait for it was the mother freaking watch band and charger not both but only one . JUST ONE.,1,36
This is totally worth the money.,"I love one fact about this. It honestly encourages me to move much more. Being able to SEE my activity is really motivating.Yes, I didn’t have to get this to JUST track my exercise. My daughter talked me into it.I’m looking forward to learning more about it!The pricing is amazing.I DO recommend a different band. The one that comes with it is very sweaty. You will get built up on it quickly.I ordered a few with holes all around it.",5,36
I Am A Fan,"This watch is easy to set up and syncs seamlessly with I-Phones. I love the fact that it came in Apple packaging in case people are worried it's not legit. It is a great tracker of daily movement and I am able to receive text and calls from a pretty good distance away. I was considering a all functional watch, but this watch answers calls as well as long as your phone is in the same building. It connects well to Bluetooth headphones and you can even control music on your phone from your watch. The battery life is really good. I charge it every two days.",5,36
"Pass the tone, the time will be.","This watch is my life! It is my partner in workouts. Reminds me to continue my impressive weekly performance. An app for every workout. I can text and talk, purchase w/Apple Pay, receive emails, check my heart rate and it looks great on. Oh and it tells time too!",5,36
Favorite Purchase of 2019,"After contemplating between purchasing a Fitbit and an Apple Watch for over a year I finally decided to cave and get this one, and I'm so so happy I did. I solely bought it for health/exercise purposes so after hearing there's not much difference between the series 3 & 4, I decided with the 3! I LOVE this watch. My favorite part about this watch is the Activity app; it really gets me excited about being productive throughout my day-- especially when there's friendly competition with my friends!",5,36
This is an awesome watch!No regrets!,"There isn’t a built in sleep tracker, but even if there was, I charge mine at night.I currently have to charge it every other day for a few hours.It does however make my business life a whole lot easier with texting, calendar and phone calls on the fly.I would definitely buy again.I’ve had three other watches that couldn’t hold a flame to this one.",5,37
Worth it!,"This is authentic Apple Watch 3 series. Came In original box and charger. I love this watch and use its features very much daily!! It helps me track my workouts, heartbeats, sleep cycles, sends voice texts and I can make phone calls through it, and check my emails!! I use all these features very much bc I have a busy life and find it so convenient especially when I’m driving to be hands free! The battery last me all day and it only takes about 1-2 hrs to charge :)",5,37
Great gift idea for my daughter,My daughter was soo happy and excited to receive the apple watch. It works perfect makes a great gift and she actually texts me right back now! She loves all the features.,5,37
Love it,"I love my Apple Watch! It was new and perfect size for my small wrist, I got the 38 mm small so it was perfect. What I like about it is you can change the face of the watch and personalize it if you want, it sometimes doesn’t notify me of texts at work but I think it’s because my phone is too far from me at work, other than that it’s perfect.",5,37
The talk to text is so accurate!!!,I’m obsessed and absolutely love it! At first I thought notifications weren’t working properly but then I figured out its smart enough to know if your phone is close enough that you are using that so it only alerts the phone. Seems like your phone has to be at least a foot away. The talk to text on it is so much more accurate than on the iPhone. Super happy with it.,5,37
Works as expected,"It's an apple watch, you get what you expect. I replaced my fitbit blaze with this and I think the only thing I don't like is the battery life is 2 days at best and it doesn't have sleep tracking. I had to download a free app for that. It does have some added features the fitbit did not have though, I was able to import my medical records plus you can talk on it and respond to text messages which is great when your phone is in the back of the house and you don't feel like running to get it.",5,37
9/10 WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND,"I am such an apple fiend. literally i was very excited about this because it was such a good deal but i was scared because i didn’t know if this product would come with no problems but GOOD NEWS!! my order came in two days (with prime) and the box was sealed and the watch was BRAND NEW. i love my purchase.the only con with my apple watch is the battery life. you would definitely need to charge it daily which was a con because i had the fitbit versa lite and could go 3 days without charging. however, if you need full specs of the apple watch series 3, the apple website is your best bet but i would say purchase these because you get exactly what you pay for- brand new.",4,37
Upgrade from a 2 to a 3 - so worth it!,"I upgraded from a 2 to a 3. So worth it. I immediately noticed the improved speed, the much better Bluetooth connection when jogging with wireless headphones, the altimeter function, and better battery life.",5,37
Love the health tracking features!,"I was not sure I wanted an Apple Watch but decided to get one after my Fitbit stopped holding charges.It is super comfortable, easy to set up and although I am still learning all the features, I love the health tracking system!",4,37
Wonderful Watch,"I debated for a long time over whether or not to get an Apple Watch or get something on the cheaper side. I'm so so happy I decided to go with the Apple Watch. It's great at tracking my steps and my sleep. I didn't think I'd used the texting very often but I find it useful if I have to run to one side of the office to do a task and can't bring my phone. Staying connected at all times, is very important to me, especially since I have a family. The battery life isn't the best but I can get about a day and half worth of heavy usage out of the watch. If I don't play around on it too much, probably longer.",5,37
Wonderful product,I never wanted a smart watch.Thought it was too much money and not necessary.My husband gave me one for Christmas a few years ago and I love it.I don't want to go back to just a watch any more.I love seeing my texts and calls without getting out the phone.Alarms and many other things are very useful with the watch.,5,38
Step down from Version 5 to Version3,"I was giving an apple watch by my sons.When I needed to replace it I thought it was a version 3.When I received it it was smaller than my old one which I learned was a version 5.However, I love my 3, it does everything my 5 did and like the smaller version since my hands are small for a man.Apple Watches are the best!",5,38
How did I ever not have one?,"Love this watch!! Got it when it was on sale around February and it’s the best thing ever. I always wear it during work and school. It’s comfortable, convenient, and the ultimate flex combo with AirPods. It’s also great for its GPS feature, sleep tracking features, and workout/activity features. I honestly can’t believe I lived without one for so long! Also shipping was fast, almost overnight. It came in the actual Apple Watch box with a charger included and everything works perfectly!",5,38
COMPLETELY WORTHLESS,I CAN'T EVEN GET THE DAMN THING TO PAIR WITH MY PHONE.DEFINITELY GOT RIPPED OFF HERE.COMPLETELY WORTHLESS.,1,38
Great watch,"Purchased this as a gift, but didn't realize at the time that it was GPS only (not +Cell). Returned unopened.... We have another model of this watch and it's a great version.Sleep tracking on the apple watch isn't awesome because it's not a built in function of the watch (like it is in fitbit) but everything else is fantastic.",5,38
Doesn't work with iPhone 6 anymore.,"So disappointed in Apple. I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Hey phone is an iPhone 6. So a little old, but not that old. I double checked compatibility before purchasing. This watch with the latest updates is not compatible with her phone anymore. I'm so upset at Apple! Will likely purchase some other less expensive watch now that will work with her phone.",1,38
This watch only pairs with certain iphones,"The Series 3 used to only require a 5s, since iOS 12 and watchOS 5 were a pair. Since new watches are now shipping with watchOS 6, they require a 6s since it and iOS 13 are a pair. It’s not possible to pair a Watch with watchOS 6 to something lower than iOS 13.This was a gift..and is now useless. Apple you should be ashamed.",2,38
Overall excellent except low battery life,"I was pleasantly surprised to find an Apple Watch on Amazon but have no regrets so far! After comparing several models of fitness trackers, the watch just won out. It has done well with swimming, biking and running. My only complaint is the short battery life. I charge it overnight, workout int eh morning, and go to work and by lunch the battery is over 50% gone. Besides that, I have enjoyed all the other features!",4,38
It's a watch but so much more!!,"There is a bit of a learning curve for me but my teenage is helping.It's nice how everything (phone, computer, Alexa....) links up and talks to each other so if my phone isn't right nearby, I can still be reached and reach out!!So many options of apps to try and it syncs to the ones already had!Wish I had caved and purchased sooner!",5,38
Good for a couple weeks,Great for about a month until the screen wouldn’t recognize any finger movements. I would try to unlock the watch but wasn’t able to type in the code. It was still receiving notifications but the screen showed that it was on 38% battery -it was fully charged- and the time was stuck on 7:42 even though it was three hours past that. If you do buy this product make sure to get apple care or else you’re just throwing your money away.,3,38
Stopped working completely after 6 months,"This watch stopped working completely after 6 months. There was no physical damage to the watch. Looks like a software/ OS issue. Tried doing a hard reset press by pressing the side button and digital crown at the same time for a few seconds- Apple logo shows up for a few seconds and then the screen goes blank. Didn't sign up for the Apple Care, so no chance of getting it replaced through Apple. And no help from Amazon on this as it's past the 1 month return window.",1,39
Worth the money!,"Honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made in my entire 22 years. Not only can you reply to texts from the watch, you can add apps that you use on your phone, and you can even control Bluetooth devices if you aren’t carrying your phone on you. I absolutely love the activity tracker as well. It’s so fun to personalize your watch too! Although I wish I bought the bigger size, I am still so happy with this purchase and it’s definitely worth the money!",5,39
Prezzie for the Hubby,He was beyond excited to get one. He got interested in it after he got me one for my birthday so I was nice and returned the favor <U+0001F60A>. Now we can battle for calories lol,5,39
Envio,"Excelente producto y el envio llego antes de lo indicado, todo como nuevo y sellado en su caja! Recomendado!!",5,39
Great starter watch Great price,This was an EXCELLENT buy for at least $30 less than most sellers. I expected refurbished for the price but it was brand new. The differences between the series 3 and 5 were not enough for me to justify the big price difference & I am not disappointed. I have small wrist so I also found slimmer bands on amazon for only 8.99 making me love it even more.,5,39
Design flaw—doesn’t consistently mirror the iPhone.,"The iwatch would only mirror the alarm on my iPhone inconsistently—usually not. Spent hours on phone with Apple, at Apple store. Store sent it out for repair and they were “not able to replicate” so sent it back to the store just out of time for me to return it to Amazon. There is a design flaw in this watch—don’t buy it and if you do, don’t expect AppleCare to cover the defect if it’s over their head.",1,39
Call - Text from your watch - very impressed.,"I’m very impressed with this apple watch. Now I can answer my phone or see the text message using this watch. Receive calls. Make calls. Can set alarms using this watch and without having to pick up the phone. I also liked the Fitness tracking functionality. Overall, it’s a very good watch and I’m impressed with its functionality.",5,39
Works Ok.,This was for my wife so the only thing i don't like is when she answers the calls thru the watch! I hate the tunnel effect and the delay. I feel like that should be the one thing that should work best overall the other functions!,2,39
Love the apple watch!,"Very pleased with my Apple watch.I gifted my last watch to my mom and got this one.Love the white band and the watch itself, too.The 38mm size is perfect for me and the apps do all I need for them to do.I highly recommend the apple watch to anyone trying to watch their health (sleep, steps, etc).It's a useful tool for that, but also to receive timely notifications, etc.",5,39
The worst!,Impossible to pair it with my iphone!,1,39
Glad I bought it!,"I bought the watch to track my exercise. It also encourages you just to move more. So I'm moving more. I'm 76 years old with bad arthritis, so moving is not always something I want to do. But the watch breaks it down into small increments that even I can achieve. The watch works well, synced right into my iPhone. Nice to take care of phone calls without having to run to get my phone.",5,40
Wishing I'd purchased in store,I'm wondering if I got a refurbished watch. I purchased this to replace a watch I lost. The battery life does not seem as long as my previous watch and the dial on the side sticks. My previous watches dial was very smooth. Makes me think this is a refurbished watch. I wish I'd bought one in person at the apple store,2,40
Apple Watch has converted me,"I don't like jewelry and was extremely hesitant as to whether I should've gotten it but I decided to give this a go for fitness tracking. I must say, it has changed the way I thought of jewelry. It feels very comfortable and it definitely is worth the price based on all the things you can achieve with this gadget, especially fitness-wise. Battery life is good, my watch can go two days without charging. It looks stylish yet comfortable. It gives you challenges as you progress on your fitness journey. Answer calls and texts from your wrist. It's versatile and can be worn with different wrist bands, from daytime to nighttime. This was definitely a good buy.",5,40
Beam me up,"This is a product I didn’t know I needed until I got it for my birthday. I feel like Dick Tracy and Captain Kirk at the same time. I’m 55 so I think I’m so incredibly in awe over the technology that I can’t give a very thorough review. I teach water aerobics and it is completely waterproof. Yes, I’m fan girling over a watch.",5,40
For the price it’s good!,The battery life is pretty good sometimes I won’t charge for two days and still going. I don’t wear it to sleep so I can’t say much about the sleep tracker. honestly I just use mine for the work out settings on it butI don’t see the point of having one but it is cool that you can answer calls on the watch that was a big plus for me,4,40
Best new thing I’ve bought!,"I’ve had my Apple Watch for a couple months now, and I can say it’s changed my life! I 100% recommend it to everyone! It definitely encourages me to be more active, and I love reading & replying to text messages on it. It has so many cool things about it- I can’t imagine not having one in my daily life! I was very happy with the price I paid for it buying this one on Amazon.",5,40
This is 100% on me,So overall I love the watch. I have had one before so I'm not surprised. The only problem I have (and I admit this is on me.) is that it is only blue tooth. I went to my cell phone carrier to try adding it to a plan and turned out that the version of the watch I got was not compatible. If i had known this i would not have gotten it but honestly i carry my phone with me everywhere so its not really a deal breaker. I wanted the cellular function as just a security blanket/ convince just incase I forgot my phone.,5,40
New in the Bix,"Perfect!!!!Came in new sealed packaging, with all the accessories.Broke my original and wanted to stick with the series 3.This was exactly what I was looking for.",5,40
Dont buy this watch for a fitness tracker!,I bought this watch after I fell and broke my fit bit watch. I have never been as disappointed in a Apple Product. It tracks me as exercising in my condo but not when I am biking outdoor with a heart rate of 150! It is absurd. What is even more absurd is the amount of time and setting changes I went though with support to fix the problem. I cannot believe a company that big would screw a consumer this way. Do yourself a favor. Do not buy this product for fitness. End of story!,1,40
Doesn’t pair.,It does not let me connect. I’ve been at it for more than 2 hours. I’ve literally searched up so many way to fix it and it just keeps doing the same thing <U+0001F644>,1,40
Great watch on the cheap,Ordered this for a great price and love it not a 5 or 6 but it works for me paired it up with a metal band and a protector that I ended up taking off because of moisture Other than the protector the watch paired up with the band love it watch is great and has had no problems what’s so everThank you,5,41
Surpisingly comfortable for someone who does't like to wear watches.,I had a Fitbit Charge 2 for a while that was good and served it's purpose but I still would take it off when I was home. The Apple Watch is surprisingly comfortable! Fitbit's app is still better than Apple's Fitness apps in terms of simplicity and ease of use but there are a lot of other apps that work well. Overall very happy with my purchase!,5,41
Its Apple Watch!!,Like these as I own all apple products and was missing this. Got this for a thanksgiving deal. Worth the money as all the other companies charge close to $200. Like the activities rings . Battery lasts for upto 2 dats but can be increased with theatre mode when on trip,5,41
Disappointed,Bought this for my wife. Was excited when it arrived but after multiple tries it wouldn’t sync with my wife’s phone. Even tried my phone with no success. Called Apple support and still no luck. Amazon returns while seldom used was excellent as always!,1,41
Didn't know I needed it until I had it,"Love this watch. The fitness tracking is great, sometimes it does short me a little bit if I'm on the treadmill 30 minutes and the watch only says 28. The band is super comfortable and the smaller face isn't too big on my tiny wrist. The messaging and calling from the watch works so well. Just love it.",5,41
DO NOT BUY PIECE OF JUNK,"This product is a piece of crap!!! I have had this watch for one week and the screen popped off the first time put it on the waterproof mode. I didn't hit it or drop it or do anything to it that would cause the screen to pop off. Heck it was only my third time wearing it and the screen freakin popped off! I took it to apple and after hours of fighting they said that it would be $239 to fix it! The tec told me it was ""strange for the screen to come off without cracking"".This piece of crap device couldn't last one week being warn normally.So basically i am out $200 because i put my ""waterproof watch"" on its waterproof mode. I will never buy another apple product again and implore amazon to get this piece of garbage off their site!!!",1,41
This is legit a brand new watch.,OMG. This is legit a Brand New watch. Mine came exactly like you bought a brand new at the Apple Store. Everything is still wraped in plastic cover for $100 cheaper if buy at Apple Store. I also check serial number and it's brand new. Never been turned on. Still have all the warranty and everything like a brand new device. Get this deals quick guys. So so happy with my purchase.,5,41
Great Gift!,"This was a gift for my GF, she loves it. I took advantage of a heavy discount for the 42mm, I wish I bought 2 instead of 1.It's pretty fast and it has almost all the functions the series 4 does. The screen size on the 42mm is ideal, specially for those who has difficulty reading small letters.The series 4 is not a worthy upgrade unless you value the ECG and more screen area. Other than these 2 ""features"", you can have the same experience with the series 3 by almost half the price.",5,41
Super excited,Absolutely love this watch. Had a Fitbit for 8 years . Made the switch and very happy for it. Don’t get me wrong Fitbit is great too but Apple Watch is awesome.,5,41
Apple Watch a cherished gift.,I received this as a gift from my husband.I love it and it has helped me to be more mindful of my activity levels and kept me from sitting so much.I couldn’t have received a better gift!,5,41
AMAZING PRODUCT,I literally couldn’t be happier with this product!!!! I gave a one star to the sleep tracking because honestly it’s terrible and any good sleep tracking app costs money. But that’s not what I bought it for and I don’t even use it! I love this product and I will continue to buy future apple watches when they actually improve on something!!!,5,42
You will need case and adapter to charge your watch.,"I was a little hesitant about ordering this Apple Watch, only because there was some bad reviews. I am glad to say I LOVE MY NEW Apple Watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking of ordering get a shock-free case! Especially when you are not use to wearing an Apple Watch( you will be amazed at how many time you hit you wrist). It can perfect wrapped with an extra adjustable band and charger cord but the box didn’t contain the adapter pieces",5,42
Upgraded my Fitbit,"Pros: has a lot more functions than other fitness watches.Cons: the battery needs to be charged basically daily.I had a Fitbit Blaze prior to this and while I liked it, it felt like a single purpose item. I opted for the series 3 over the 4 because the cost savings was so significant that I didn't feel I needed the ECG. I also do pre-paid cellular so the cellular watch wasn't an option (only post-paid and the big 3 are currently supported from my understanding).",5,42
Not Charging.,I bought this as a gift for someone and this BRAND NEW watch isn't charging! I took it to iWorld and they said they will replace it because of the warranty (fair enough) but I have to wait 7 days for the replacement because they don't keep any stock of it! I don't purchase Apple products for myself so this was my first experience and I'm disappointed.,1,42
Detached Glass,"I have enjoyed my Apple Watch 3 Series. It has kept me active with the Monthly Challenges and the Special Edition Challenges. I’m able to compete with friends. Overall it is wonderful. However, there is a crack along the glass face of the watch and the glass has become detached. ( There have been other people who have had the same problem) That is disappointing since the watches are pricey and because I have only had it a little over a year. I have contacted Apple concerning this. I will give another update once my watch is repaired.",5,42
Good product!,"I like my new Apple Watch because I’m a very active person. I like to hace everything set on my watch. The only thing is the battery life, that I need to charge everyday. I though this product needed to charge just one day per week. But I’m general it’s a good product for the price.",4,42
Stopped working after 2 months,"Looked like the real deal, but I purchased my watch from the Apple store and it's been working for three years. Purchased this one for my gf and it stopped working after two months. That was a waste.",1,42
Won’t pair with iPhone 5s,"I just bought the Apple Watch 3 based on the posts that say it will work with iPhone 5s;however it will not pair, says I need an update even though my phone just updated last night to iOS 12.4.3 and says it is up to date.Is there anything I can do other than buy a newer phone?",1,42
a great watch on the go!,"whenever you want to see time, weather, and mostly doing activity on the go, the apple watch 3 series is the best device for its job on the go. this watch can do lots of things as you do without picking up your phone when sitting down or doing something and it does the job right. in order to use the watch, you must pair it with your iphone in order to use it. but the process is very simple and fast since the updates and data doesn't require much memory. the price for this apple watch is a steal and it is worth it for yourself or as a gift for you family and love ones. 10/10 would recommend.",5,42
Great purchase!!!!!!,I purchased 2 and they work great. Battery life is pretty good as well. I get about 1 1/2 days off one charge. I’m up and moving a lot so it’s always counting something or going off so that’s actually pretty good battery life in my opinion. I don’t wear the bands I instantly installed some Velcro bands on them so it’s the perfect lightweight watch.,5,42
Beautiful Watch but make sure to get a case,"First off the packaging was phenomenal brand new Apple Watch for a great discount! The only thing I really noticed was that the Apple Watch box was a little bit damaged probably from transit it was not a big deal at all. After I opened the box I removed the contents which were: instructions, an extra band size small to medium, a magnetic charger, and the Watch face with attached wrist band size medium to large. I also bought a screen protector and a case because I have been reading a lot of reviews that say the Watch face breaks very easily so I did not want to take my chances. I’m still waiting to get my phone repaired so I can complete the setup so I will make sure to keep you guys posted one I get it repaired.",4,43
A must for iPhone users!,Extremely happy about this amazon find!!! Apple almost never gives discounts so to get this at a discount was something we had to go for! It is sleek and the fit is great. I have used it for phone calls and the quality is great. The caller never has a hard time hearing me. Talk to text is also very easy to use. The pixels of the screen are great and very clear.,5,43
The Watch I didn't know I Needed,"Well, I decided to treat myself to this watch and let me tell you now I know why people are praising it, I can't live with this after years of saying ""I will never waste my money on that"" You won't know you needed this watch until you get one.Battery last a long time and it just perfect.",5,43
Awesome reliable product,Have had for a few months before reviewing. Battery goes for almost a week in a single charge which is much better than previous versions and the newest one. Very impressed. Usually review mtn bike stuff. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Good tracking on workout app. Updates are regularly every two weeks. Clarity during call is good. Siri clarity is pretty good. Definitely gonna recommend you people.,5,43
Still a solid purchase in 2020,"I got this as a intro my to smart watches, already having an iphone it seemed like a no brainer. At just under 200 bucks this thing rules. Activity and heart sensor features keep you more health conscious. App interactivity with your phone is seamless. Battery life is solid, if you're curious about smart watches and already have an iphone at this price point its worth a shot.",5,43
Very helpful even if it's not the newest Apple Watch.,"I love my Apple Watch!! I was looking for a good deal in my price range that could do all I needed like track my exercise, etc. It can do all that and even more. I am blown away by all it can do especially since it is not the latest version. If you are looking into apple watches this is a good buy and the battery life is insane. I wear it all day everyday and when I charge it at night, there's still half a battery life left on it.",5,43
Watch comes as described!,"This product was phenomenal. To me it took kinda long but only because I was so eager. I’m fully satisfied and happy. When it arrived, the box was in mint condition & it felt like I bought it from the Apple store. Everything was in one piece and so clean. I messed up the box cause it got stuck with some glue from a tab I wasn’t supposed to take off but I was so angry, that’s how neat the box was. Kudos to the seller and success on any future sales!",5,43
I love it,"I spent a long time being too cheap to buy an Apple Watch. Due to some health stuff i decided to suck it up and do it. With fitness app it makes your workout tracking easy. With the rings it makes it easy to see your activity for the day to see what you need to improve on.In another area, it has helped a ton at work. I work in a shop and it’s not always convenient to check my phone when i get notifications or calls. It’s easy to glance at the watch and see who’s calling or read the message. Super convenient.",5,43
Great Watch!,"I didn’t really know what to expect when I first got it, I really hoped I would like it because it has such a large price. It’s really made me think about how much I need to exercise.The Activity app rewards you for workouts you do with trophies on the activity page. There are apps that can remind you to drink water, take a moment to breathe and also count your sleep. It’s definitely motivated me to be more active and take care of myself.There’s also the super useful feature of being able to answer back to texts. You can either talk to your watch to do text-to-speech or you can draw letters out to form sentences. As well as text, you can call people using your watch and talk to them with no problems.Overall, a very nice product. If you’re lucky enough to get one at the price I got (26% off) that’s even better, but it would still be worth how much it costs had I not had that discount.",5,43
Just Awesome!,I bought this for my 23-year-old daughter and she loves it!!She uses it to track her daily activities along with texts and calls. It does a lot more than she gets out of it.She says her battery life is great and would probably last her several days although she does try to charge it almost every night.,5,43
Great watch,"I love that it tracks my steps, and reminds me to move a little bit at the end of each hour if I've been sitting at my desk.I have only one time been able to close the exercise ring even though I have several times done over 15,000 steps and it will show me as having done 7 minutes of exercise.",4,44
Great sporty watch PLUS,"Love being notified of texts while busy at work so that I can look at later, etc. The sport app is fun and meeting my goals is helping me keep on my exercise track! I charge it every night and have no issues with battery life. Plan to get more bands to change the look. I am a physical therapist and love the timer on it! I got a deal on Amazon.",5,44
Series 3 doesn't pair with iPhone,"Bought this watch 8/21 new in box and when it arrived it would *not* pair with my iPhone 6s. I took it to the apple store and they were at least able to rule out that there wasn't anything wrong with my phone. They deemed the watch defective. Do *not* buy from Amazon, better off spending the extra 50$ to get directly from Apple.",1,44
Perfect for outdoor use like running & hiking!,"I have had the watch for a few months and it is working as I expected it to work. I use it while running and hiking. I can upload my favorite songs without having to carry my phone. The only limitation is that you need to have apple music to upload songs on your watch. The battery life is good (not great unlike other apple products), I charge it once in every two days.",5,44
Amazing,Love Apple and this beautiful watch!,5,44
Won't work with any prior models to iPhone 6s,My only issue was that this series is not compatible for iPhone 6. This watch won't sync to any older models previous than the iPhone 6s and after.,4,44
Thought it was a great product. Let down,"Arrived quickly. Comes with a magnetic charger cable (no wall plug), two bands (1 S/M, 1 M/L) and all the instructions in the sealed box.UPDATE***Faulty band magnetic system. Watch bands demagnetize and fall randomly.I don’t if I just got some weird batch, but my bands keep coming off the watch randomly. They seem to get demagnetized and the watch just falls free. Shattered my screen and left my watch useless. Maybe it’s a weird batch?",1,44
Amazing device,"Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! He uses it mostly to track his steps and workouts and he says it does great! It does a lot more like answering calls, sending text messages, and lots more! We watched a few YouTube videos that show you the many features! Definitely worth it",5,44
"Awesome smart watch, love it","I was debating between an Apple Watch series 5 and 3. Obviously got series 3 and I don’t regret it, has everything you need and you would not even notice the physical difference between 3 and 5. Totally recommend, great smart watch!",5,44
Buy the dang watch!,"If you’ve been thinking about buying this for yourself but you haven’t because of the $$.... BUY IT! You definitely don’t need it. But you will be so excited about all the insanely cool features. You will also look very stylish with all the different bands you can get. You’ll get tons of compliments on it. Hop on the bandwagon.Seriously, talking to Siri is a breeze. I use the timer often (for workouts or cooking). Pinging your iPhone is a lifesaver. I could go on. This was a prize to myself for getting a new job and I don’t regret one cent! So happy with it!",5,44
Worth the hype!!,This watch is everything you could want and then some. It’s worth the hype. It’s worth the money. It’s worth your time!I highly recommend this item.,5,45
Another great Apple tech toy,"My son received this for his 13th birthday and he loves it: using it for his alarms and reminders, texting with his friends, tracking his steps, and even *gasp* checking the time! Personally I don't have a need for one product to tell me to pay attention to another product but if you're a gizmo kind of person, it has its charm.",5,45
DOESNT WORK WELL IN WATER,"Product was pretty good for about 2 months. First time I got into water though messed it up completely and wouldn’t turn back on. Very frustrating to say the least and when buying on Amazon, you don’t get the best customer support when it breaks. If you are buying, I would HIGHLY suggest getting a waterproof case if you plan on getting into water. My watch was submerged for no more than 10 seconds at a time as I was in a pool.",1,45
So far so good,"Only got it a day ago, bought it because a colleague bought one. And some of the features are things I wanted likeHeart rate monitoring and emergency contact if you suffer a fall and don't move.Plus since an older model the price was more appealing. Setting up was amazing it practically sets itself up, never seen anything like it. Therefore, so far so good.",4,45
A great product.,Love the gen 3 Apple Watch.It does everything it says it does well. The battery lasts throughout the whole day and helps me better keep track of my meetings and appointments. The display and functioning of the watch is beautiful and simple as well. Totally recommend.,5,45
Got this a few months ago and works great,I got this for my S.O. a few months ago hoping to save a little money by getting it on amazon rather than in store and so far it works great! It does not come with a charger so you'll have to buy that if you don't already have them but still in the long run cheaper and works well. He loves it!,5,45
Great,Package came Monday they said it was going to be delivered the watch set up automatically once I turn the watch on it’s synced with my phone and I just added some information aside from that everything seems to be working wellAs far as battery life I just received it today so I will give or add another review soon,5,45
Meh Apple Watch.,Works as expected.It's an apple watch. You're really checking Amazon for a review on this? Go watch a tech YouTuber or something!Has no native sleep tracking and you barely get through a full day anyway so can't really wear it to sleep.Worth it at the discounted price only.,4,45
Love it,"Love this watch ! Only takes two hours to fully charge and lasted 3 days until next charge , I love how it tracks everything and helps keep you on track",5,45
Out the box connectivity issues,"Great product, only trouble I came across was, that it did not want to connect right away but after contacting Amazon and even taking it to the Apple store everyone helping came to a conclusion that it was just going through an update in order to fully connect. So dont panic if it doesnt connect right out the box. We still dont really know why this happend to my watch.",5,45
Love this apple watch,"Got the 42mm on sale for Prime Day. Didn't see the need for the latest Apple Watch Series 4 and I still don't, even though you aren't able to get the curved complications on the watchface that the new Series 4 has. Oh well.Other than that, it's a great device. I use it to track workouts and biking. Easy to control music and to find my phone, which is often lost in my apartment.Battery life can run on the short side (I usually can get a full day out of it but if I forget to stop tracking a workout, I may only get about 75% of a day out of it).",5,46
Worth the “Weight”,"I bought the Apple Watch to help with my weight loss goals. I’ve used the pre-installed Activity and Health apps synced with my iPhone to track exercise and the MyFitnessPal app (by UnderArmor) to track my calorie intact. Two months in and I’ve lost 12% of my body weight, well on the way towards reaching my target.Yes, the watch has a bunch of other neat features and apps, but it has exceeded my expectation in keeping me on track and motivated to loose weight and develop healthier habits.",5,46
Very useful watch.," Fast shipping, great value, and I love everything about itsaccessibilityfeatures except it does not read text messages like the phone doe. I am visually impaired and this is the very useful watch.",5,46
SO fragile!,"I ordered this product a month ago. I was pretty satisfied with it. It has to be charged daily so I was unimpressed with it’s battery life. However, my biggest complaint is that when dropped from less than 3 feet distance to the ground, the screen completely shattered. I can’t believe it. I’ve had iPhones for over ten years but this was my first (and last) watch purchase. I’ve dropped phones before from greater distances and never had a problem. Very disappointed!",2,46
Apple phone software compatibility,Spent 2 hours at Apple Story to connect to watch.Had to buy an Apple XR Iphone to get it to function.,5,46
Not reliable,The watch was not what I expected. The connection between the 2 is not accurate.After 2.5 weeks I started having issues with the connectivity between both watch and phone. I have returned after 3 weeks.I was a bit disappointed about the watch since I have wanted it one for sometime.,3,46
Not waterproof,"Lesson learned! I bought this product and the very first and only time I go into the pool it died and won’t come on. It will just a little less than the actual cost to repair it. Take my advise, buy in a Apple store which would include warrantee and so you won’t end up like me!",2,46
A little upset,Love the watch. But I was very upset it did not come w a charging cube. Has a charging cable but no cube.I had to go to the dollar store and buy one and what would u know it did not work. So I am now on the 3rd charging cube cause the cheap ones don’t work so well. You would think if ur spending over $200.00 on something it would come with a outlet charging cube.,5,46
Watch that helps me stay fit,"I really enjoy having this watch! I am super excited about the tracking heart rate, calories, and syncs to my beach body on demand app. I do wish this watch would track the amount of sleep like my Fitbit did. It’s easy to use to connect to phone to write messages and take phone calls. . All in all, I am glad I got this when I upgraded instead of another Fitbit.",4,46
Great gift,Easy to use once you get the hang of it & small enough to not get in the way with day to day activities. If can do so much. Great gift,5,46
LOVE,So I had a series one and hated it. I only ordered this to be petty towards a coworker who thinks she’s the you know what for having an Apple Watch. I LOVE it! The battery life is perfect and lasts from 6 am until I put it on the charger around 11 or 12 (it’s above 20) and I use it frequently at work. The specs are amazing and it’s very simple to use. I suggest getting this one as it’s the same as series 5 only in smaller sizes and less colors.,5,47
Like it a lot more than I thought I would.,Kinda wished I would have bought one sooner. When smart watches came out I honestly thought they were stupid. I really only bought this for fitness tracking at the gym and throughout the day. I really like everything about it. If you are on the fence I suggest trying it out.,5,47
LOVE,This is my second Apple watch series 3.I fell and cracked the screen on my first watch and the touch screen wouldn't work any more.Repair would have been almost as much as replacing the watch.So happy to have a fully functioning watch again--I use it for tracking steps everyday and for notifications.I even make and answer phone calls when I'm gardening--my WiFi reaches outside.,4,47
"New? A dud, a lemon is what I got.","Brand new & it never worked. Talked with T-Mobil first, then Apple Support because I could never get a picture. Tried everything Apple said, didn’t work. Nothing else they could do. Called Amazon, their sending a new replacement. This was my 34th wedding anniversary gift. This lemon pisses me off.",1,47
A great companion to iPhone,"I bought this on Prime Day to upgrade from my 38mm Series 1. I’ve only used it for a day but it’s an improvement over my old one. The face is a good size without being huge and ugly on a smaller wrist. Since this one is water resistant instead of just splash proof I’m no longer afraid to have it exposed on rainy days. It seems to be a bit better in terms of tracking my heart rate during a workout as well. Not as good as a Series 4, but it was half the price during Prime Day so I’m very happy with it.",5,47
Don’t know you need it until you have it,Just awesome! I was on the fence for a while about getting the Apple Watch. Co workers were saying how great it is and how you didn’t know you needed one until you have one. Mainly use for the fitness tracker. The use with the iPhone is seamless. If you are on the fence I say take the leap. It’s well worth it.,5,47
Scam,This does not pair with an iPhone 6 so I returned it. Such a scam because you have to get an upgraded phone which I don’t want. I’m fully content with my iPhone 6 it works just like the other ones.,1,47
Great watch for a couple years old,"Im happy with this 3 series apple watch. Battery life is great. Connects to the app well.Tracks and monitors sleep, movement and more. Lots of wonderful features. Take it for a swim. Texting while your phone is close which is handy. Play music and much more.",5,47
Apple watch 3 series didn't pair,The apple watch could not pair to any phone. We made phone calls to ensure that this was the case and told us to ship it back.Kinda disappointed.,1,47
Does not include charger plug-in,"Watch is great, came with two different size wrist bands and charging cable. I’m giving this one star though because it did not come with the wall plug-in part of the charger. I noticed a lot of people mentioned that, but it says in the description that it was included.It said in the description that there was a plug-in that the usb connected to. False advertisement. But the watch functions perfectly.",1,47
My Apple Watch is fun to wear.,"I particularly like the activity mode.It keeps me moving, and it keeps track of my hiking.One thing I do find puzzling is that the mileage tracker is notmaking sense.Both my husband and I set our outdoor walk at exactly the same time, but when my husband and I take the exactly thesame hike,, my mileage is approximately 1/2-1/3 mile less than mY husband.My I phone does this, too.I like the ability to take phone calls on the watch, but I don't like the fact that I cant switch to my phone part way through a conversation so I can have privacy.I do have to take my phone off as I don't want to be awakened to""stand up.""",5,48
"Brand new, won’t work!","Just bought this watch for my wife it won’t pair to her brand new iPhone X, Verizon local store has no idea why it won’t and now she has a take off work on a Friday And drive an hour and a half to the closest Apple Store to have it fixed!!! And this item was brand new out of the box!!",1,48
Screen breaks spontaneously,Have had two watches that the screen spontaneously broke on. This is supposed to be a known defect that apple will repair but they denied the claim on the first one. I haven't tried sending in the second one yet.,1,48
Great Value for the Price,"I bought this on the annual ""Price"" drop and I haven't regretted it yet! Out performs (obviously) the older watches and with the sale gave me a chance to up the size to the bigger version! It is a must have for those with slightly larger wrists so the pressure isn't so bad on the wrist/skin itself! Always get a case or screen protector!",5,48
BROKE IN TWO MONTHS,"DO NOT buy this watch. I received my watch on April 4, 2020 and it broke on June 6, 2020. I called Amazon and was told that the warranty expired on the watch on May 31, 2020 and because it broke 6 days past the warranty date Amazon will not be doing anything to help me. Apple is now sending me a box so that I can ship the watch off to get it fixed but Amazon was totally unwilling to offer a replacement. The watch is 2 months old and broke through absolutely no fault of my own (I was using the exercise app, the app froze, I forced a restart on the watch and it is permanently frozen on the apple loading screen) and yet they offered no remedy. Save your money and buy this somewhere else.",1,48
Great Watch!,"I love my Apple Watch! It works great, tracks my activity, can read my text messages from the screen and set daily goals. This watch is not on a cellular plan but works through Bluetooth. I love it!",5,48
Love it,I love this watch. Been wanting one for a while and finally pulled the trigger! I have a small wrist so went with the 38mm and it’s perfect! Gonna take a little while to figure out all the cool things it can do!,5,48
"no, get this one","honestly, i feel the series 5 is just overhyped. i mean sure, the always on display could be nice, but this has all the essentials and then some. this watch has been amazing the past two weeks, and i got the space gray, 38mm variant, and i have discovered no problems. its great for the money, although i do recommend getting a new band, but thats just my opinion. i opted for a milanese band, since i dont really care for the sport band feel. however, dont get me wrong, the sport band is in great condition and shape. overall this product will serve you well for your time-telling activities and workouts!",4,48
Loving this series 3 smart watch in summer 2020,"I was debating on getting a smart watch for some time now and finally decided it was time. I am pretty happy with my purchase. I was a bit skeptical about buying a series 3 in summer 2020 but this watch has everything I need. GPS, heart monitor, receive & make calls, text, exercise monitor, you can take pics off your phone and more. I appreciate the price point and the abilities it has. Shipping seemed rather quick for me too.",4,48
Junk,Bought used from Amazon warehouse won't charge anymore,1,48
Series 3 replacing series 1,"My aunt had a series 1 and cracked the screen. My mother and I surprised her with this series 3 as a birthday gift, and it’s faster, more responsive, and water resistant. 3 features the series 1 didn’t have, but it’s more than enough a reason to upgrade.",5,49
Have an IPHONE 6s or newer!!!!,"My friend and I ordered this same watch at the same time. We also both had the iPhone 6. My watch would not connect to my phone but hers would. I called apple and they were very rude. I got mine a day after hers and he said there must have been an update on mine that hers didn't get. He basically called me a liar saying there was no way her watch connected to her phone. Long story short, I was getting a new phone anyway. The watch is AMAZING but they do not make that very small but important detail clear enough!!!",3,49
Great Product for an Active Lifestyle,"The apple watch has been super convenient for my active life. Aside from work usage, the watch maximizes my ability to be as mobile as possible without having the need for my mobile phone to be around me all the time. This has definitely increased my phone life's longevity and user experience as I can leave it charging all day or use it when I like without the worry of battery life. Notifications of apps are pretty seamless as I get texts and other info I need to help facilitate daily work and life. Phone calls are much easier to take especially with air pods at the ready. Overall, a great compliment to those that live with iphones.",5,49
Use it every day,"I was concerned about getting a series 3 when they’re on 5, but I am so happy with my purchase. Battery is better than expected, I love the 38mm size, and I’m really happy with all the features.",5,49
Another quality Apple product.,"I enjoy the convenience of this watch, especially to use for working out and exercise tracking. It’s nice also to quickly be able to check texts when my phone is in another room. It helps reduce screen time because I’m not distracted by other apps when just checking a quick message.",5,49
Mom loves it!,My mom loves this so far. I got it for her for Christmas because the Garmin forerunner45 was irritating her her (and me). She was so impressed by all the features. Since she has an iphone i figured it would be easier for her to navigate it since shes familiar with the software. She says the battery dies quickly but thats all. She makes me want to get one.,4,49
Exactly what I expected,"This is a great deal for the watch.I've been researching for a while and am glad I found this offer.As far as the product itself, sleep tracking is non-existent (fitbit is really great with it).I do however love the reminder to stand and to breathe.",5,49
Don’t expect a refund quickly.,"I absolutely love this watch! I tried Garmin but did not like the lack of functionality with an iPhone. I was originally not thrilled about charging my watch daily but I do it for my phone so when you put it in perspective, it’s small potatos. Would buy again. Also, it’s at a great price point.The only downfall to all of this was dealing with an Amazon refund. I sent the watch back because I had already had one. The return was started 25 June and here it is, 6 July and nothing from Amazon. This process is an utter disappointment. Get your returns in check, Amazon.",5,49
Very happy with this product,I've had my Apple Watch Series 3 for a week now and so far I'm quite happy with it. The only negative is it doesn't count steps - I was surprised because I was kind of expecting it. I did download Activity Tracker from the App Store to get this feature; was very easy to install and it works excellent except you cannot put it in the Watch Face to have it next to the time.,4,49
Love my apple watch,"I love my Apple Watch. I use it mostly to track workouts, it’s slim and very accurate. I would buy this all over again!",5,49
Love my Apple Watch!,"Love it! Great size for my small wrist 38mmYou are in sync with your iPhone.Able to see your all’s, txt, email as well as reply from your watch. I can listen to my pandora, Apple Music etc. I strongly recommended it!”. Get it, you will love it!<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>",5,50
Love it but it doesn’t accurately track activity!,"Love this watch! The only problems are after a week the battery life started to shorten and that it doesn’t accurately tract your exercise. I was really excited to see my activity stats bc I do high intensity workouts for about 45 minutes at least 3-4 days a week and it says I’ve only worked out 10 minutes.. If you run for 30 min it will be more accurate. I do really enjoy that it tells me to stand up or breathe (I have anxiety so when my heart rate increases it reminds me to breathe and it really helps). Overall, I love the watch and would definitely recommend but don’t take to heart if it says you haven’t reached your goals!",5,50
How did I ever do without?,"I was on the fence about getting one of these, but now I love it. It has so many features and apps available it's amazing. The watch tells me when I should get off my fat butt and do something and awards me when I do. And hey...it even tells time.",5,50
You won’t regret buying it!,I love it. It’s super easy to setup and I love all the different options. I got it for exercise but reading and responding to messages is huge. Battery can last about 2-2.5 days with no charge. I purposefully bought the 3 not 4 because I didn’t need the cell plan and I’m not missing anything! Also came in brand new box from apple (I know that worries some people).,5,50
"One generation behind, still ages ahead!","It’s hard to know how much you need an Apple Watch until you get one. Then you suddenly find yourself more liberated from your phone, a feeling of freedom that comes with feeling connected without the burden of thinking and checking a device. If anything comes up, you feel if subtly on your wrist. I only use my Apple Watch as Notification Center basically and already so pleased with what it has contributed to daily work flow. I’m sure the more expensive series 4 Watch is great too, but at double the price one has to really think hard if the few extra functions make sense.",5,50
Almost prefect!,"Love the watch, and all the features, BUT and it’s a big BUT, the battery life sucks! I’m on the move all day and can only charge my watch at night, meaning sleep tracking is unusable.I knew this going into it, the battery life is the only thing I miss about my Garmin Vivosmart HR.",4,50
Great,Love it! But when I tried to add it on to my phone line they said it was a Wi-Fi only watch but I am really upset because I wouldn’t of got it from Amazon if I would’ve known that!,3,50
Great watch for first time watch owners,"Really helped me get back active. I loved not pulling out my big phone whenever I had a notification, I just looked at my watch. I returned this item just because the series five came out and I want that one or the series four.",5,50
Defective bummer,"Was SO excited to order and receive this only to have gotten a defective product. The haptics/vibrate are nonexistent. Apple Support could not help with a hardware issue so I’m exchanging for a replacement. Its been really frustrating and the disappointment continues. It’s back ordered 2 weeks... plus I had put a screen protector on the defective watch. All in all, a big bummer <U+0001F61E>",3,50
Paying for convenience,"I wear my watch everyday has was very impressed and happy with it. I mainly use it to track exercising and fitness. The watches face did have an issue about 6 months in. After a visit to the Apple store and waiting 2 weeks, I was sent a new watch.",4,50
"Separate App Store for watch vs iPhone, can’t get most apps for watch","Battery life is not good if you’re using your watch for daily activity more than a couple hours a day. Not a lot of apps for apple watch, that really stinks",4,51
10-Oct,"to be honest, i was hesitant about getting this product but my watch arrived in perfect condition with no scratches or any flaws on it! i searched hard to find an issue but it was impossible! it came with two different size bands so you could choose which fit you better. and it also came with the charger, however, it didn’t come with the box to hook the charger up to but come on, everyone has them laying around everywhere haha!",5,51
Mostly Hype,"I was expecting more based on the reviews, but I’m kind of disappointed with the overall Apple Watch experience. Maybe I’m a minimalist, but I actually prefer my Fitbit Charge 3 over the Apple Watch. It’s not that comfortable, the battery life stinks and I mostly find the breathe and stand reminders annoying.",3,51
Great!,"I was skeptical to buy this off of amazon but after reading the reviews I gave it a shot, I was not disappointed! Watch came packaged in brand new unopened box. I am still figuring out how to use it but so far I love it, easy to set up and link to your phone. 10/10 would recommend.",5,51
I’d recommend any version if the Apple Watch,Bought as a gift and they love it. They were using an Android based watch and this was a game changer for them.,5,51
Great choice,"This device replaced a first gen Apple Watch as I wanted to swim while wearing watch. Great decision. Price point was good, the watch functions far better than the previous watch and the battery life is incredible. I can often go 3 days before recharging!Very pleased with the watch.",5,51
I love my apple watch!,"I love my apple watch! I've had it for several months now, probably approaching a year, but I'm still learning about various features available on it! I love that I can use it for work (I work in the medical field), I love that I can set myself reminders, respond to texts. track my steps, record physical activity, etc! My only con is I wish the battery life on it was longer. I usually get about 2-3 days of use before it's time to recharge it, but that it a very mild complaint.",5,51
I should have stayed with FitBit,I am not happy with this product from Apple. The more I wear this product the more I dislike it for monitoring my activity and health. It gets away from the simplicity that Apple has made a hall mark of their products. I should have stayed with Fit Bit.,1,51
Cool app integrations,"I love the app notifications - not just for texts emails, and calendar reminders. The Apple Maps integration is cool with vibrations each turn.",5,51
Love that its bluetooth,This watch is a perfect watch and phone combo that I do not necessarily need to purchase a phone plan with. I have it blue toothed to my phone and so when i am driving or out and about its perfect. I don't have to drag my phone in and out of pocket or purse overtime i need to use it.,5,51
Perfect!,"I bought this used from Amazon Warehouse. I read some horror story reviews about the used products, but figured I’d chance it for the price considering I could return it within 30 days if I wasn’t happy with it. It arrived in the original packaging. The watch itself, although described as “very good”, was closer to “like new” condition. It didn’t have a scratch on it. All of the original cables and manuals were included as well as both the small and large size bands. I have smaller wrists, but my previous watch was a G Shock. Since I was used to a larger watch anyway I decided to go with the 42mm. I’ve had it for a little over 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it and have no complaints! Money well spent!",5,52
Perfect watch,Perfect Apple Watch. The battery last for about two full days with using it during a workout. Easy to set up and love that it’s tracking my steps. Perfect for all the activities that I am doing. Works perfectly and the screen is clear and not blurry.,5,52
Excellent product!,"The shipping took a little bit but it was lost in the mail. The product looks brand new. It came with everything you would expect and it came with the plastic in every item. The box was sealed. The only complaint I really have is the box it was delivered in. It was too big of a box for this and was open on one end. It could have easily slid out. Other than that, it’s exactly as I expected!",4,52
WORTH THE MONEY!!!!,"The watch came without any issue. The battery is pretty good, no issues with the touch screen. All the tracking and notification work great. Easy to accept and hold calls. Thanks speakers work great. I really recommend this watch to anyone who's looking for a new smart watch.",5,52
Surprised,I never thought I’d enjoy the texting from my watch (voice) but I’m really impressed with all the features that are tied in with the iPhone I was using the amazfit stratos until I decided that I wanted to try a Apple Watch it was a great decision if you are using a iPhone get this watch you won’t regret it,5,52
Great buy!,At first I was scared to buy an Apple Watch from Amazon but this one is perfect. Came shipped to me as if it was straight from Apple themselves. Got here quickly and works awesome (way faster than my series 1),5,52
AWESOME,"Only had this for a month, still learning about it all the time. My fav feature is the timers an alarm. I use those daily as a nurse. Makes me look efficient when I show up just as promised for a patient activity. So many cool things on this watch. Definitely a perfect purchase.",5,52
Well Integrated,"The Apple Watch Series 3 is an awesome device! The hardware and software work greatly together. There's not much of a difference between Series 3 and the latest Series 5, great value at half the cost of the 5. If you're into working out, this is a great buy. The watch looks great and works flawlessly.",4,52
Wife enjoys her new watch.,Watch looks brand new just as you get it from Apple.Wife wears it everyday to the gym to keep track of hers steps and heart rates.She likes the watch but hates the fact that she has to charge it everyday.Overall saved about $30 through Amazon.,5,52
Very happy with this purchase!,First let me say I’m a 5’11 male 320lbs with a 10in wrist and this watch fits easy with the large band that comes in the box as well as a smaller band for smaller folks. I am very pleased with this buy and recommend it to others and last my watch came brand new never opened.,5,52
"Replace the Apple Watch band with a quality band. Be careful when putting on, do not drop the watch.","My first Apple Watch broke within the first 5 months. The watch band is not that easy to put on, it slipped while hooking the latch. The watch fell to the floor, the face shattered. No refund or credit or trade in. Useless !",4,53
Don’t recommend this product. Fitbit is better.,"This is my first purchase of an Apple Watch and I’m not impressed. Like all things apple it doesn’t play nice with others and I have to reboot it every time for it to save my workouts. And it will sync but not save with my food tracker. It very delicate, doesn’t track sleep, and you have to charge it EVERY DAY and the charger that comes with it is not fast.",1,53
Works great,"I am happy with what I bought. It says it is waterproof so I swam with it and then this is this weird noise on the crown when I turn it and it is even more laggy than before but still works. And also on the apple website you can get the exact same price for it on their website. But still Awesome buy, recommended!",4,53
Love it!!,"I bought this after having a cheap $30 ‘smart watch’ to track my steps. I am obsessed with my Apple Watch Series 3!!!! One of the best things I have ever purchased. Works great with Spotify and Runkeeper, which was one of the main reasons I purchased the watch.",5,53
Love these!,Love these bands Mary and expensive very comfortable I love the variety of colors. I have gotten several and change them out frequently because it’s so easy.,5,53
Got this as a gift for my wife,"I got this watch as a gift for my wife as it checks all the boxes for what she needs in a smart watch. Well worth the value now for those who don't need the bells and whistles of a series 5. I would highly recommend it for anyone who needs a Wholesome gift for a super active person or someone who needs the convenient health monitoring features. Also, it was so convenient not having to buy this in Store. I have a friend from Australia who definitely gets props for suggesting this to me as a great birthday gift.",5,53
Perfect.,"I love it. My mother kept talking about hers and ended up persuading me into getting one as well honestly I thought it was just another fad like it’s just another watch ok cool, but I kinda like it it’s pretty and I can track my exercise and walking accurately.",5,53
Great buy,"Love, Love this watch! I should of bought the 42mm one because i think the face looks smaller but I love the watch works so well!",5,53
Great performance while working out.,Not sure why I waited so long to buy this. Very easy to set up and use. I did have to buy alternate bands because I have an allergy to the sports bands. Performs great while workingout. Great tracking while I run. Tracks my sleep. Great Apple product.,5,53
Amazing value !!,"Bought this fir my husband for him to try out the waters on an Apple Watch (he’s a classic watch kinda guy), he loves it ! It’s simple enough that he can use it and he loves the activity tracking for fitness ! We only have to charge it every couple days so that’s a win too",5,53
AMAZING,My husband got me this for our wedding anniversary and I love it so much! I’m a busy stay at home mom and I always am bad for missing my notifications so this is a life saver!,5,54
I love it,"I was on the fence about getting an apple watch but I love mine. Great for sleep tracking, workouts, step count, and getting notifications without being on your phone. I would recommend an apple watch to teachers or anyone in a field where being on your phone is not acceptable but wanting the security that you will not miss any important calls or text.",5,54
Good value,Only have it for a day but looks good and getting use to it. Would have been better if they would have included a manual or instructions on it instead of looking it up on internet and calling a friend several times to ask questions.,5,54
Awesome find!,"This watch was everything I dreamed of. I can do everything from this watch. Send and check messages, email, time, temp, etc....it arrived right on time came in brand new no scratches no scuffs. It was like I bought it at the apple store but for a lot less money lol. I’ve got absolutely no complaints abt this watch! Everything is just how I imagined it would be 5 stars across the board! This is the iwatch space gray 42 mm",5,54
Great price and performance,Decided to take the leap and glad I did. Love the watch and app. Went with series 3 given price and happy with features and performance at less than half the cost of a series 5. Read the online comparisons and decide if the series 3 works for you.,5,54
Motivating for exercise.,I absolutely LOVE my Apple Watch. It’s great on for the go and I love that it tracks my activity and learns to push me when exercising. It’s funny how a watch actually motivates me to move more because I want to watch those rings close!,5,54
Saved a Life,My son loves his watch. He has severe asthma and his watch saved him from getting worse. This watch has many amazing features and was offered at an affordable price. I am grateful I ordered it from Amazon. It arrived in a timely manner and it looked awesome once it made it to my house. It is worth the investment.,5,54
An Amazing Product,"I will always love apple because of their amazing products. My Apple Watch has been a blessing for me. I've been way more active and been way more motivated to exercise more each day. I would say I was a pretty healthy person even before my Apple Watch, but my Apple Watch has allowed me to become the person I always wanted to be. The battery life is amazing. For me, one charge can last me a day and a half. All in all, the I would completely recommend getting this Apple Watch.",5,54
Great for the price!,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and for the price and the series model, it was a great buy. It came brand new, wrapped in plastic, and was easy to set up. Definitely might buy one for myself. It's been a couple months since I bought it and I haven't found anything wrong with it.",5,54
LOVE!,I was hesitate to buy such an expensive watch but I am so glad I did! I feel naked without it,5,54
Wish I would have bought sooner,"I have been contemplating buying an Apple Watch for some time, but didn’t want to spend a ton of money.My friends talked me into getting a 3 for a less costly option with a lot of the same features.So happy with my purchase, wish I would have bought it sooner!",5,55
Great watch!,"I love this watch! Its functions perfectly and charges in to time. Its sleek and not at all heavy, which I was worried about with the thick bands. It came with both S/M and M/L sized bands which was wonderful. Packaging was brand new and the device worked straight out of the box. Would definitely purchase again!",5,55
Don't waste your time shopping around for other smart watches!,"I bought and returned something like four smart watches, not wanting to spend the money for an Apple watch.I wasted a lot of time doing that.I broke down and got an Apple watch and absolutely love it.If you have an iPhone, you really want to get an Apple watch to pair it with.It takes a lot to knock my socks off, and I am very pleased with this smart watch.",5,55
Fantastic for monitoring wheelchair fitness,"I just love my Apple Watch! Came on time. VERY easy to set up. It’s a super fun gadget and I’m so grateful I went for the series 3. In my budget and works great. I highly recommend. I use it mainly for fitness tracking. I am a wheelchair user and LOVE that I am able to put the watch in “wheelchair mode” to track and monitor my wheelchair pushes and fitness. Good job, Apple! It’s nice to have a reliable fitness tracker for wheelchair users! Bravo!",5,55
THE WATCH IS A MUST,"It is amazing especially because I bought it for such a good deal. Apple never disappoints, I absolutely love all their products. This watch send me notifications when I am unable to use my phone and it also keeps track of all my steps daily. The battery life on the watch lasts a long time I usually use it all day and at night I just charge it and it’s ready in the morning. The delivery time was faster than I expected.",5,55
"With the generous discount, get this very cool Apple product now!","I am a Mac guy, and a registered Mac developer, so it would be expectedthat I would love this watch. I am getting more use out of this product than I expected. And the ‘coolness’ factor alone is worth it, especially with the $80 discount.",5,55
Buy it! The best deal for any apple product right now!,"I’m siked! Never in a million years could you have convinced to buy an Apple Watch! But for the price I gave in! Y’all, this watch has GREAT quality. I’m not big on buying the latest on every product, but the series 3 is just as good as what they have out now , unless you’re very techno savvy and you need the latest updates! The delivery went great, it was delivered in 2 days, I do not have prime. Everything works like new! No glitches or scratches or anything fishy! Buy it! $180 .. you can’t beat that! I work in a warehouse and will be buying a case for it.",5,55
Can anything go wrong with an apple product? Love it!,"It's an apple product after all! Can anything go wrong? I'm glad I bought it during the thanksgiving sale and gifted it to my S/O on her birthday. She loves it a lot and uses it to track everything except her sleep.It's a great motivator for her to do her excercises, so that's a plus!The battery life is not as great as compared to my galaxy watch, but still reatais charge for a good amount of activity time.",5,55
Great purchase,App is pretty user friendly and battery life is approximately 3-4 days which is pretty normal. I love the fact that I can see the clock and text messages very well even out in the direct sunlight. so far it has been a great purchase.,5,55
Worth,It is tricky to make sure that the product is original. Product came in a sealed pack and good packaging.,5,55
Watch face detached,"This is my third Apple watch and I really like them.. However, I have only had this watch for 2 months and the entire face of the watch is cracked and coming off. It is 10 days past my return date to Amazon. Now I get to go fight with Apple to try and try to get them to replace it. Very disappointing. Liz E",1,56
High schoolers will love this product.,"I loved everything about this product. I am still in high school and a ton of my friends always ask me if they should get one. Honestly, yes. It makes it easier for me to stay connected without having to go on my phone. I can get message, email, twitter, instagram, etc. updates and notifications. I can call and text from it without having to get my phone. (as long as I’m connected to wifi) When I lose my phone, it is super easy to ping it and I find it right away. I love using it to track my fitness and setting goals works great.",5,56
Excellent product,"This was a gift for my wife, as I already have one for myself. She loves it and wears it almost everyday. The watches have been very resilient. Never had any issues.On the negative side, they can get a little finicky when you upgrade your phone. I had to erase my watch and start new. This is not a big deal to me but was inconvenient for certain.",4,56
Good For Everything,"One of my best buys this year was this watch. It is incredibly sporty and cool in that it is extremely fashionable. You can wear one for any occasion (it helps that it has a wrist band that you can change out). It is very easily adjustable with sizing and with wrist band colors. Easy user friendliness as well. I'm personally not a sports person, but I find my apple watch INCREDIBLY useful. You can check text messages, missed calls, social media, etc. all from looking at your wrist. Overall, excellent product and much better than I expected.",5,56
Motivational with reminders to move and breathe,Hard to understand setting up to use. Didn’t know it would track sleeping,4,56
So far so great,So far so good I have no complaints I actually brought my daughter the same one in black last year and she loves hers too...I thought I wasn’t going to like the white and even better when I found out I can change the case n band so I actually like it a lot<U+2764><U+FE0F>,5,56
I love it,I had been getting Fitbits.They always break within the year.I love the Apple Watch even though it is more expensive.It’s also completely waterproof.Fitbit would probably break if you sneezed on it,5,56
Great watch but read if you're on the edge,great watch not many things wron with it if you're thinking about a series 2 i would get this because of the stuff they added and how much better the 3 is but the 4 is much alike this one so dont spend the extra money on the 4Great watch,4,56
Happy,Had it only day but so far it’s actually what I expected. I really like how it mirrors my phone. I like the notifications on my watch.The face I can see at night without my glasses. Love it. The only thing I don’t like is the battery life.,5,56
nice watch for price,I got this for my wife essentially to track her running milage. She is extremely happy with it and is accurate for running/walking and sleep. Reminds her to breath every now and then which I guess is life saving which I appreciate. She would buy this again and recommend.,4,56
Great Purchase,"I bought this watch during a one day flash sale. I've used a FitBit which I love, but they had too many technical issues. I took a chance on this watch and have had no problems in the three months I've owned it.It has more options than I need, but I really love the ones I use.",5,57
What you need!,"My husband loves this and he and my daughter-in-law have set theirs differently to suit their particular needs.He's had several fit-bits in the past.He likes this much more, especially the way it inter-phases with his phone.",5,57
Amazing!,"I love my new Apple Watch! It’s so handy when I’m at work and don’t have the time to pull my phone out of my pocket. The only thing that’s not the greatest, is the rubber watch band it comes with. I have pretty small/thin wrists and it’s too tight for me to wear. I highly suggest buying your own band, but other than that... it’s incredible.",5,57
Hands Free!,I love my Apple watch. I was skeptical at first when I was deciding to buy one just because I wasn't sure how often I would use it. Now that I have had a few weeks to break it in... I LOVE IT!!!I am a new mom and I hate that being on my phone a ton makes my baby want my phone all the time so being hands-free is crucial and convenient which is a huge factor when it came to picking between a fit bit and apple watch. I love that I can answer my phone while trying to change a diaper or make a bottle!! Everything else is great too but that is the best part for me :),5,57
Works well for lap swimming (and everything else)!,"I bought this item primarily to track lab swimming and it is wonderfully! I didn’t realize how much I would use it for other things. It’s really great for normal use of text messages, calling, etc. even without the cellular data. Love it.",5,57
Eh,Love and hate productDoesn’t update nor pair with my phone automatically I have to constantly manually do it.,5,57
Best value for Apple Watch,"Bought this for my wife who said she wasn’t sure she’d use an Apple Watch. Now she wears it everyday and has seen substantial value in having it from checking/sending messages, tracking runs, and the Wallis talkie function.",5,57
Great deal!,"I highjacked the black band for home wear, and they’re so soft! You can tell that these were made with good quality. You can’t even tell you’re wearing them, they’re so soft and lightweight. Would recommend to anyone!",4,57
"Great product, but battery won't go a whole two days","Battery life is less than expected.Some reviews had indicated it could go 2 days.I would say you can get a solid day and a half at most.I don't mind charging everyday, but I was a little disappointed in the short battery life.But hey, it goes about as far as my phone, so I can live with it.Love it!",5,57
Love the ease of not carrying a phone but it has to be near by,I use this for work and while walking. Do not use it for sleep have not tried yet. Can’t get to of at from phone as it will not jump on hotspot or WiFi so not sure what the deal is there. Great for workout and texting,5,57
Would,"I bought this to monitor my workouts, i thought it would be better than my trusted Fitbit. Pauses at least 15 times per workout while I’m strength training. I’ve looked up countless ways to fix this issue and after altering all of the settings and still having this problem, i saw an article that the heart rate can’t be read if my wrist is tattooed. Never had this problem with my Fitbit. Huge waste of money, also has to be charged every single day which is a real hassle",1,58
Excellent buy,Very good watch the series 3 is a good budget watch and hold up to the series 4 and 5 don’t waste money if you don’t need to the 3 is a excellent option would highly recommend and will still be supported for the next 3 years.,5,58
I returned it so idk.,I returned it but it seemed like one heck of a smart watch. buy it.,5,58
Essential if you like Apple products,"I’ve had this for over a year and I love this thing.I like my iPhone and my iPad, so this thing is awesome.Works great and pairs easily to my phone.The most useful thing I have found is the contactless, Apple Pay function.Don’t have to take my wallet or phone out to buy stuff.So easy.",5,58
Worth the money!,"I was hesitant about buying online, but it was worth it. I love this watch and all of its capabilities. I had a versa and lived it too, but it got damaged and so I upgraded to this. This does so much and I feel like I hardly ever need my phone!",5,58
Do not purchase this watch <U+0001F621>,I bough this Apple Watch on May 2019 it been 6 months and is giving problems.. doesn’t alert me calls or text messages and lately Apple Watch was showing To update It which I did now since then every hr is asking me for a password in order to work even though showing the time on my watch <U+0001F621><U+0001F621>,1,58
Pretty and great,My daughter love this watch beautiful and good price and came in the right time,5,58
Nice!!,Seems to work good. No problems. Has a cover over it so it has not broke the screen.,5,58
<U+0001F44E><U+0001F3FD>,FIRST OFF I LOVE AMAZON BUT THIS WATCH IS DEFECTIVE AS HELL I LITERALLY BEEN TRYING TO PAIR THIS WATCH FOR 6hrsSTILL NOTHING IM SORRY BUT THIS WATCH IS POO POO,1,58
Gift For Girlfriend,"Got this as a gift for my girlfriend as she’s been wanting one for a while. I have a Series 3 as well but in black and I love it. The fitness apps are great, shows a lot of information on the watch and even more on the app on your phone. We haven’t had any issues and it’s such a convenience.",5,58
NO CHARGER,Was super excited to receive my Apple Watch but it didn’t come with a charger... I have never gotten an Apple product that didn’t come with one before so not pleased that I now need to pay extra for that,2,59
Exactly as expected,"I’ve had for a few days now, I love it. It came brand new, easy to use! I wasn’t sure if these things were worth but it definitely is!",5,59
Great for every day use can last up to 2 and half days from a 100%,It’s a brand new Apple Watch works as need it’s not something that’s great to track sleeping with do to how thick it is and it can brake but the steps tracking great text back is goodnotifications great and heart ratesensoris little off but it’s a great device after all,5,59
Very good!,Exactly the same thing you’d get from the Apple store without the hassle of lines and people! Amazing quality definitely get if you workout or are an athlete! I use it for swimming and sending messages mostly as well as Apple Pay! So many cool features!,5,59
Cheap and easy way to introduce yourself to a smart watch.,Fast shipping and product was brand new. This is my first smart watch and I thought I would buy this one just to try it out. I really like this watch and will definitely want to upgrade in the future.,5,59
Good buy,"Nice watch, really is water proof. I tested it in the shower got the watch really wet, I swiped up on the screen and hit the raindrop and twisted the crown and then dried it off. Works perfectly still. I like it.",5,59
Don’t buy!!,"Love my watch!! I’m not sure what the negative reviews where about, but mine came brand new and factory sealed! It paired perfectly to my phone and everything synced perfectly. I’m now updating it and it’s working smoothly! Best purchase ever!!*EDIT*Keeps asking for my passcode. Goes to different apps by itself and now it shows an Apple logo. I thought it was dead, but when I put it on the charger it still had half a charge left!! Very disappointed!!",1,59
Love love love,"After using a fit bit for so long and returning the 1st Apple Watch I got years back, I am so happy I made the switch!!",5,59
"Gift, only complaint was battery life","Bought as gift. Came quality packed. Only complaint, if you can call it that, was that the battery life wasn’t what was expected. Not sure what the life is supposed to be but lasting all day seems acceptable to me. Great product either way.",5,59
Great watch,Works great and connects to phone good. Only thing is battery don't last all day. Apple needs to update the battery life in these watches.,5,59
BROKEN,Ordered this for my sister's birthday present. The watch wouldn't even connect to her iPhone. We spent many hours at the Apple Store troubleshooting but they couldn't figure it out. STAY AWAY.,1,60
Check iPhone software compatibility,"Watch won't pair with older iPhone 6.We called apple support and they stated that older iPhone 6 software updates weren't sufficient for newer Apple watch series 3.They became incompatible somewhere in the middle of the effective life of the iPhone 6, not at the onset of iPhone 6s or 7",1,60
Really worth the money and looking great and so helpful and so entertaining,Really worth the money and looking great and so helpful and so entertaining,5,60
Affordable,My daughter loved it. And a hell of a lot less expensive then the apple site.,5,60
38mm is the Perfect Size for Wife’s Wrist,"iWatch as always knocks things out of the park. We originally purchased matching 42mm series1 but it was too big for the wife’s wrist, so I got her the 38mm Series 3 as an upgrade and she loves it.",5,60
Good watch,Really like this watch. I got it to use mainly to monitor my exercise.I don’t really like wearing watches but the band is really soft and pretty comfortable.I had to watch YouTube videos of course to learn how to use it.,5,60
Love it!,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it! It works perfectly and is so useful! He also bought me the series 3 in silver and I love my watch! I never thought I would be an apple watch person but now that I have one it is great! We also purchased charging stations from amazon to charge our phone, airpods, and apple watch all at once and it is so nice!",5,60
It’s a great watch,I love this watch just as an awesome product I work with them every day,5,60
Love this watch!,"This watch came exactly as shown and is another high quality Apple product. I decided to get the Series 3 instead of the Series 4 to save some money and I am so glad that I did. It works flawlessly being paired to my phone and computer, Siri works great, and the battery actually lasts a few days if you turn it off at night. I'm beyond happy with this product and could not recommend it enough for anyone who doesn't need the latest, most expensive watch but still wants the Apple Watch experience.",5,60
Customizable,Convenient and annoying simultaneously. Good eyesight and hearing a plus. The tactile notification is nice. Being able to glance at message subject matter without digging out the phone is great.Good first impression.,5,60
Not what I expected,"I thought that it was an apple watch with just a few features, but Apple surprised me! It has a ridiculous amount of features! It has amazing batter life, the apps are flawless (as usual), and every type of tracking is very accurate. I would highly recommend the Apple Watch 3. It may not be a 4, but it's definitely an Apple Product (fantastic quality with amazing features).",5,61
I got this watch so I could have music while running,"I love this watch!!!Combined with my airpods, I've downloaded music to the watch and can go running without having to carry my phone or an ipod.A real game changer!!!",5,61
Love this thing!!!,"It’s not a iPhone, but it is a Stylish fitness tracker/notifications tracker. And it does it’s job perfectly. I recommend getting new bands to keep yourself different. There’s many nice ones on Etsy for $15. If you work out it’s great!! And if you are in the office it helps keep you off your phone and looking Professional.",5,61
I love apple,Absolutely bang on your buck. It does what I wanted to do.,5,61
Super easy to use,"Love my Apple Watch! Connects very far away from my phone and I love the ease of texting without my phone as well as Apple Pay. Band fits very nicely and comes with multiple size bands. No need to buy from the apple store, came exactly the same from amazon",5,61
Nice to have but not necessary,"Nice and comfortable. Hate the low battery life of a smart watch vs traditional watches. It last me only a day and a half. I also hate that it doesnt track sleep automatically. You have to download sleepwatch for that function! Otherwise it’s just ok, I don’t use it that much.",3,61
Happy customer,I’m so happy with this watch! I recently became an apple customer and I’m happy! This watch is very nice for the price I have no issues and was new nicely packaged I can keep track of my steps and much more,5,61
Fix my Iwatch,Was working perfect until today 6 months later. Turn it on and bam it’s a green static screen that won’t go away. Turned it off and back on... still nothing. Very disappointed.I’d like it fixed or replaced.,1,61
Empty box / missing product,"Amazon box arrive untampered, Apple Watch box end cut open - and is empty.NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER",1,61
Okay battery life. A good assortment of apps. Alarm is loud. It really motivates you to stay active,I love this watch. Battery life is decent as long as your not on a 2hr phone call using the watch. Couldn’t believe how well it helps me sleep by monitoring my sleep patterns and helped me make better sleeping choices. It also helps me stay moving and exercise more. And I couldn’t beat the price $80 off was an excellent deal.,5,61
When purchasing the item it gives wrong info; the item in not! compattable with all Iphones.,"My son's iphone 6 does NOT work with that watch, so it's unusable. Ive returned the item about two weeks ago to Amazon, and haven't heard anything about refund yet. It is NOT in process.",1,62
Its ok,Its fun to use the walkie feature but honestly aside from telling time its just a toy. Still its fun to have because i can look at alerts during meetings and it just looks like im checking the time.,5,62
Size matters.,"Looooove! I had a 38mm that I managed to loose in the park. This time I got the 42mm what a difference! So much easier to use, see and hear. I’m 4’11” and pretty proportionate. It’s perfect and not to big or clunky.",5,62
Game changer for Apple iPhone lovers,"Love the product it’s a game changer for Apple cell phone users. I’m kind of disappointed that it doesn’t come with sleep tracking technology. But after linking it with a sleep app it seems to be tracking very well. Also, kind of related it doesn’t sync with my Fitbit scale. You’ll need to top off the battery once a day if you plan to wear it all night for sleep tracking. Mine uses 50% with moderate use each day.",4,62
Great for tracking workouts!,"I love using the Apple Watch during workouts to keep myself accountable and also keep tabs on how many active calories I burn with each kind of workout. It's convenient to silently get text and call notifications as well since it helps me to not be on my phone as much. It's definitely an item of convenience that not everyone needs, but I got it mainly to keep track of my physical activity.",5,62
Very excellent like new Apple Watch,So far it’s been working great. All the features on the watch work nice. Just updated to the new watchOS and is faster than ever. Really recommend. I bought it as a reused and or refurbished product and it came like new.,5,62
Love apple products,"Great products, work very well with IPHONE, easy to use, all the operation is intuitive, I use it to track my excercese everyday, and it can play songs while running, all in all, love this watch, love apple!",5,62
Price and shipping,"Great price and fast shipping, this will be a Christmas present so will not be able to see it in action until the 25",5,62
So far so good,"I just received mine and the packaging was just like the buying it from the store itself. I’m impressed and the price is so worth it. The battery has sustained itself so far, it lasts all day and charges quickly if you need a little recharge during the day. I do like to track my sleep so I’ll charge it for 30 minutes before sleeping and wear it while sleeping and use the Pillow app to track sleep. Overall this purchase was worth it and $80 less than the apple store!",5,62
My 1st ewatch,Love this watch. Was worried at first because I thought that I would bump into something & kill it. I bought a watch bumper which gave me some peace of mind. Watch is spectacular. Why did I wait so long???,5,62
Expensive but good time teller,Really expensive watch. Tells time well. Features are somewhat tricky to use because it is small. Apps have very limited functionality in general. Only get this is you have an iPhone. It will be tough otherwise.,5,63
Good decision for me,I just got mine this morning so I can’t say much about battery... but I do can say that I am in love with it. The 38mm is perfect for my small wrist (which I thought the opposite) and is really confortable. The way it let me to set move goals it helps a lottt. I will come back to review the battery life and other factors.,5,63
Love this Apple Watch! Glad I purchased,Bought this as Very Good from the Amazon Warehouse and it feels just like new. Haven't seen any cosmetic issues with it and it works perfectly fine. Been using it everyday and the battery life is great as well.,5,63
Research pays off!,"After a lot of research, decided to purchase the Apple Series 3 watch. Came delivered as indicated, new, in box with 2 bands, and charger.Initial setup very easy but needed my grandson to help me with more advanced settings, which was faster and easier than using YouTube!So far, love my purchase!",5,63
"Great smart watch, OK exercise device","I have been using the iWatch for awhile. As a smart watch, there is no other watch that compares. As a workout device, it is lacking in easy of use. Yes, you can start, stop, and take splits but with not nearly the ease of the most basic sports watch.",4,63
I love it!,I absolutely love my watch! I've been using it for a few months and it is absolutely perfect. I do wish I had gotten the one with cellular though! But I'm still really happy with mine and would recommend it to anyone!,5,63
Good if you know why you want it,I bought to track my activities since I’m very lazy. But if you don’t plan do use related to sports or exercises I don’t recommend.Battery can last up to 2 days if you don’t use several apps all the time,4,63
So far so good,"I have only had this for about 4 days and so far so good. I have had to charge it twice, once right out of the box and once again today. So far it seems to do everything I need and want it to do including motivate me to get up and move more.",5,63
Keeps nagging me to breathe but I like it anyway,"I love this watch.I have come to expect that from Apple.Although it’s an older model, it does even more than I need.I do get tired of it nagging me to breath or stand up.I don’t wear at night so I don’t know about the sleep tracking",5,63
Apple Wows Me!," I love this watch. Always a huge fan and consumer of all things Apple. Artfully made. Very nice for either sex, though I feel this size is more “fitting on a feminine wrist”.",5,63
Great product and you need it,This was a treat myself purchase (Thanks Donna and Tom.. treat yo’self) and I honestly don’t know how I did life before this. I love the activity tracker and being able to do things from my watch. I’m trying to talk my husband into getting one for him too!,5,64
Happy Wife = Happy Life!!!,Bought it as a gift for my Wife.It isn’tthe most recent version and doesn’t have every option.What it does bring is exceptional value when compared to other newer models...and my Wife loves it!!!She gleefullyshares with me new things she’s learned about her device on a daily basis!!!,5,64
Nice Watch/Fitness Tracker,Very pleased with my purchase. Definitely more accurate than the Fitbit.,5,64
Great buy !,Dose everything I need it to do and for a great price especially if you don’t want to go for the latest series.Everything came wrapped and brand new and went beyond my expectations . I mainly use it for checking my phone notifications and replying to texts.The gps is amazing ! And the battery life lasted me all day from using the gps multiple times and doing other little things and it still had 50 percent left time I came home to throw it on the charger .,5,64
looks great for the price,"Why pay more, when the bluetooth version is all you need.",5,64
Former Fitbit user,"I got this instead of a replacement Fitbit because I was over the app instabilities and sync issues. It was time to explore a new option. I love the productivity aspect of this and I am much more on top of my life now with this. I have appointment reminders, email alerts, MS Teams alerts etc. The battery life is poor by design. Exercise tracking eats up the battery too. The time on charge is decent so minimal down time.",4,64
Low price and life changing,I recently upgraded from the 2 to this 3 and couldn’t be happier. This watch has great battery life and couldn’t be better in terms of motivating one to get the steps in! I love my new watch and have been a vocal advocate. I think it is overlooked for its age but it has an unbeatable price and compares well to other watch options.,5,64
The best deal ever for Apple Watch,"Like overall Apple Watch, but this one I get as gift. Like Apple ecosystem and iPhone integration. Loves to use them, when my phone away of me but still near by. They plays podcasts without a phone at all, direct on your AirPods and always track your activity.",5,64
Can't go wrong.,I'm digging it! I finally broke down and joined the rest of my family with one of these. I am budget conscious so I don't care to pay 500 bucks for a new fancy watch. I needed something to keep pace with my workout routines and this fits the bill. You'll be happy with this watch as I am. Good Luck,5,64
Noice quality,"Nice Apple Watch for cheap, bought this for my birthday, on August 28th 2020, and still love it, perfect water removal system, water resistant, haven’t tried sleep tracking yet tho, so can’t tell you that, good touch screen, the screen is pretty durable, pretty much Good quality and good purchase!",5,64
Awesome buy!!!,I’ve been wanting an iWatch & this was the best price all around!,5,65
Series 3 ROCKS!,"Very pleased to have chosen Series 3 when I had to replace my Series 1 Apple Watch -- and a renewed Series 3 at that! The battery lasts nigh unto forever, and like the Series 1, does everything I need (and MORE!) VERY satisfied and highly recommend!",5,65
Honest Simple Review,"I was a bit sketched out (which I’m sure was the intent) of comments saying it was used and/or missing stuff, but it actually came factory sealed and brand new. So that bit for me was fantastic and worth the buy.. would have been very dissatisfied if the watch was used. Battery can be good as long as you know what you are doing. Just be sure to turn off anything that runs in the background that you aren’t actively using all day such as the HeartRate Monitor (just turn it back on whenever you want to know that info).",5,65
Battery leaked battery acid on me after less than 4 months.,"So disappointed. I've had it for less that 4 months and yesterday at work (I work a desk job) I was on a call and it broke and leaked battery acid on my wrist slightly burning me and making a mess! It's still running, but the battery is clearly corrupted and I can't wear it/use it now. I don't work out with it on or hang out it overly hot or cold places so it's never been over worked so it must have been a worn out battery before I even got it a few months ago.",1,65
So far so good! I Love it!,"I was really debating whether or not I needed this watch. Truth is , I love it! I work with children and I can’t really be on my phone which makes this watch perfect for me! I purchased the 42mm , after reading many reviews that the face was too big, I still decided to try it. I compared it to my friends 38mm and the difference isn’t much !",5,65
Poor battery life and watch bands are both pretty short,"I got this watch expecting it to be top notch, and don't get me wrong it doesn't suck. But overall, I would like to see longer lasting battery life. Also I have big wrists, and the biggest watch band it comes with barely fits around my wrist. Otherwise it is a great watch. I love all the features it comes with and I love that you can answer and speak on phone calls directly through the watch. Also love the texting features it offers. Other than my first two gripes/groans, no serious complaints. Watch is decent",3,65
LOVE LOVE!,Bought this for myself and I absolutely love it! Brand new in sealed box. Easy to set up.,5,65
Should Be Called a Dumb Watch,"This watch can barely exist without a phone nearby to do anything outside of the usual. I get it that you can’t call someone if you don’t have WiFi, but how come Spotify won’t let you download music or Strava let you track your run without bringing the phone with you, the two features I was hoping to have for running. On top of that, charging the watch every night is a disservice, who has time for this!? I will say that the design is pretty cool but definitely not for everyone.",3,65
Who needs a four?,"I can't believe I waited this long to have an apple watch - I love it - and at $199 its great value.The white band doesn't get dirty as I had feared, And I love all the features.My only complaint and question is why can't the Apple Watch track your sleep as well as a Fitbit?",5,65
Great,We love our watches.This is the fourth one for a family member.It’s two generations old but it’s not missing anything we care about from the 5.Very happy with it.Very.,5,65
"Nicely packaged, arrived in two days!","Came in Apple packaging, excited to see all the functions as I learn more. I feel like it’s 100% Apple product.",5,66
Awesome,Awesome product. Would buy again!,5,66
Worth every penny!,I bought this because I was going back to work after maternity leave and can’t have phones out to be able to check on my baby...one of the best purchases I have ever made! Texts and picture messages right on my wrist! Plus it tracks my steps and some other cool stuff.,5,66
Scratches WAY too easily,"I haven’t had this thing for two months and it’s already gotten scratched. I’ve never had a watch or Fitbit scratch like this thing... sooooo disappointing, especially at this price point!",2,66
Awesome,Just what I was looking for. I work where I can’t always pull my phone out and constantly check it. This is a perfect extension of my phone and I can quickly read messages and use Siri to respond. Battery life is the only downfall. Need to charge pretty much everyday.,5,66
Best ‘watch’ ever!,Have worn this almost every day for 5 months! It is such a great tool to have with you at all times. I use it mainly for the fitness tracking and also checking phone calls and texts by just looking at my wrist.,5,66
Would buy again!,The Apple Watch was perfect. Everything came as it should. Watch is everything as described. Would buy again!,5,66
Bad Apple Watch,I did not have the watch six months and it overheated on the Apple charger and broke the screen. It no longer works. Piece of crap. Apple would not stand behind the watch so I am out of my money. Don’t buy it.,1,66
Perfect!,I’ve been using my Apple Watch for a while and I just love it! Delivery was super fast and it came perfectly!,5,66
Wish I could return it. Awkward to see the time or use any of its other functions.,Hate looking at my wrist and not seeing the time.Need to push a button to see the digital display. That means I need to use my other hand to see what time it is.Wish I could send it back.,3,66
Won't regret buying ;),Yet another amazing product from Apple. Tons of customisation. Only downside is the battery. Typical get about 16 hours use from new watch. This will degrade after a time.,5,67
Great deal,I had a really good deal . I can’t be happier .,5,67
I love my apple watch,"So easy to read the time - I am trying to learn how to use all the features, but the best thing is when I am walking with my phone in my purse and it rings - so does my watch and I can answer the call and talk on my watch. I love that feature.",5,67
Great for fitness tracking,"This watch motivates me to workout ! Keeps track of steps , calories burned , workout minutes and more ! Love competing against friends and family as well.",5,67
Amazing!!,"Absolutely love my Apple Watch!! I wear it constantly and feel so much more in tune with my overall health. It tracks my sleep, calories burned, steps, and more. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone who is in the market for something like this.The only thing I’m not a huge fan of though, is the wet feeling after you wash your hands and water gets under the band. It feels like I got my sleeve wet. Would recommend making sure the watch band is completely dry after washing hands.",5,67
Happy,So far I love it. Way better than Fitbit .,5,67
Works great!,"I am a big fan of this watch and would recommend to anyone. The integration with iPhones is fantastic and, of course, easy to use. I don't think you have to worry about spending money on a newer version as this one works really well and is so much more affordable.",5,67
Get this! Cheaper than most apple products,This watch is great and links right up with my phone..it has all my apps and it is easy to use if you have an Iphone. Choose this one over the 5 its legit the same thing and cheaper.,5,67
Battery life not good.,"Battery life decreased to about 6 hours after I bought it. I have done all the trouble shooting steps I can find. Love the watch, hate having to charge in the middle of the day.",3,67
Can't pairing at all,So excited to get it.But couldn't pairing with my iPhone at all...Talked to Apple customer service and have to ship for repair... too bummer...,1,67
Just buy it. Stop over thinking it.,"If you are still considering getting one, just do it! Great for people who are always on the go and need to continue to stay in the loop/up to date with things going on in their life. I am a college student so this thing helps me keep track of everything in my life between working at a hospital, clinical shifts, classes and tracks all my activities at work and during my actual work out. Batter life last all day and charges really fast!",5,68
Fitbit vs Apple,"I was a die hard Fitbit woman, but this Apple Watch goes above and beyond! I love all the features that synch up with my phone!I feel like this watch gets me up and moving way better than my Fitbit blaze did. I love being able to answer texts on it too! My three teenagers all want one now!",5,68
BEST WATCH EVER!!!,Love my Iwatch! I don’t know how I ever lived without it before! So convenient! You don’t have to worry about having your phone in the other room any calls or messages go right to your watch! It’s great for workout an giving you reminders! I wish I had gotten one sooner!,5,68
Functions functions functions,It’s more than a fashion statement. The functionality of the watch plays more than one role. I lose my phone and have the ability to ping for it to make a quick and easy find. I’m always updated with my current messages and who might be calling when my phone is not in hand. The fitness aspect is fun even though I’m not a gym buff. Overall this was a good investment of my money. Looking forward to upgrading in the future.,4,68
Love it,I was hesitant on buying this watch now I don’t know how I get by without it. I still can’t figure out the sleep Tracking option but that’s not a big deal to me. Being able to look at my watch rather than pull my phone out for text messages and calls has been invaluable,5,68
best gift for my brother,"I bought this watch for my brothers birthday, he likes it very much and now is giving more time in studies and in fitness club. He is able to connect the gym's equipment for more accurate exercise. The heart rate sensor to save battery life is a good feature of this series, which is also great if you're going on a long run. The best thing of this Apple Watch Series 3 is that it is more affordable than Series 4.The time is not so far when smartwatch can replace a smartphone for most of the tasks.",5,68
Size comparison!,This is my first iWatch and I loved it. Its luxury watch with great hard ware and software.I was very confused for size while purchasing so I am adding photos for comparison it might help you. I have small wrist 6.3” circumstances and I purchased 42 mm size it perfect on my wrist.Picture shows 40mm series 4(similar 38 mm series 3)vs 42mm series 3 watch.It one is great quality Apple product At Great price!,5,68
Never Again!,"It was good while it lasted. Stopped working after exactly a year. Checked Google, apparently Series 3 backlight stops working. They were going to charge me almost as much as it cost to fix it.",1,68
un boxing,I was kind of scared to get the apple watch off of Amazon but when the package got to my door step my heart went into my butt <U+0001F602><U+0001F602> as I’m un boxing the Apple Watch I see that everything was in the box and nothing was missing or broke <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD> I’ll keep you updated it’s only been a couple hours and I love it <U+0001F970>,5,68
Let me tell you what I love about Amazon,"I originally purchased the Apple Watch in February.Within a few weeks, the microphone, dictation, talk to text feature, stopped working.I contacted Amazon and without hesitation, they sent a replacement watch.New one works great so far.Absolutely pleased with everything.I haven't tested the water resistance yet (honestly it scares me to get it wet) but battery life is great and it's easy to use.Love this watch.And love Amazon!",5,68
Great watch,"I love my apply watch, it came in in a timely manner, works wonderfully and super easy to set up. Literally everything I need is on it. My only complaint is I decided to do the rings thing, that tracks how much you exercise, your vitals and such, and the watch has made me keenly aware I am WAY more out of shape than previously though. If I knew I was that out of shape I wouldn’t have shared my circles with other people. I guess that’s more of a personal problem but still.All in all 9/10.",5,69
Perfect!,"The 3 series is everything I need for activity tracking - very versatile.Easy to use and easy to charge.Works seamlessly with the app.(Oh, and it has a watch function.)",5,69
iwatch3 - used,"It's September 2020, about 7 months after I purchased and it's not holding the charge by 4pm. Even with a full night charge. Sometimes in tapping on the face it doesn't charge or it freezes :(I will not purchase a USED item ever. Very dissatisfied and sad...……….",2,69
Excellent wAtch. Mommy’s best friend,"I will update as I continue to use it. So far, it is very intuitive as it works with my iPhone X really well. I did my research before purchasing.My favorites:The breathe appFitness trackerNot being tied to my phone!Vibrations for notifications",5,69
Buy local,"I was very disappointed in this product. It continually reset and then after a few days it stopped working all together.I way not happy with the way amazon handle the problem. My advice would be not to purchase an apple produce from amazon, but instead buy local so you can get good customer service.",1,69
Wonderful watch and more!,"Such a powerful little watch and at a great price! Not the latest version, but still in the running. This is one of the few Apple products I didn't have. Super high quality like all Apple products!",4,69
Look brand new!! I’m so happy with it!!,"I love it!! I was worried that I would be unhappy about flaws, but there are no cosmetic flaws at all!! And as of right now I haven’t noticed any issues,Or technical problems!! Very very happy with it!",5,69
I’m in love, I am now a Apple Watch user first ever only one I was a long time Fitbit on owner and now I am proud Apple I like the idea of having 24 photos of my kids and my partner and of our pets on my wrist and being able to do more with the watch of the Fitbit,5,69
As Expected,"Works swell, looks sleek, and great price.",5,69
love it!,"I have no complaints on my watch.I bought it three months ago and i LOVE it. When i first purchased it, i was afraid that i would regret it, but i havnt, and would buy it again in a heart beat.|My favorite features include tracking my physical activity, find my phone, and the ability to text through it. I use them all the time. I also like that you are about to set up your phone and take the photo using my watch. Its very helpful.10/10 would recommend",5,69
BRAND NEW! Use the $50 Savings For Apple Care!,"Brand new in box. Came in mail super quick. Great value, over $50 more for the same product at the Apple Store. DO NOT forget to buy Apple care!! Use the savings towards it. Thank me later!!",5,70
Happy spouse happy house,The watch tracks about everything.When paired with an iPhone you can even make calls on it.The speaker is just loud enough and a built in mic is a huge plus.,5,70
Awesome Apple Watch!!,"I have had this watch for over a year now! Still works amazing and holds battery for days! Although says water proof, after talking to staff at Apple store, they really don’t recommend putting any electronics in the water, so I have not submerged mine yet. Still love the Mickey and Minnie and toy story faces but would like to see more interactive faces become available from Apple please. Overall very satisfied!!",5,70
Good price and perfect.,Wow I’m very glad that I bought this watch it’s worth every single Penny on it . Today I went to the Beach and I swim while I was wearing the watch with unlocks water mood. I was little bit worried if the watch turn off or something happened but just work perfect with swimming tracking . Happy happy with it .,5,70
Good,I bought to a friend and she loves it!,5,70
No cellular can’t make/receive calls unless on WiFi,I didn’t know this didn’t have cellular service meaning I can’t make calls on it unless I’m on WiFi. If I attempt to answer call on my watch I can’t hear them. It’s good for fitness tracking I should’ve just bought a Fitbit,3,70
Very comfortable!,I have tiny wrists so normally I have a hard time finding bands that fit. This band has been amazing! Going on two months and I have no desire to switch it out. I use it for work and the gym and it has been very comfortable and holds up extremely well! Would definitely purchase again.,5,70
Great!,"I’ve been loving my watch. The battery lasts longer than my day, and it charges in only an hour. Looks great and has so many great features. Download an app for sleep, and it shows you your sleep patterns.",5,70
Works well,"I end up charging it every other day, but I'm not a hardcore user.I don't use it for music or to talk to people.I mainly use it for notifications which it works well with.I was surprised as how nicely it integrated apps on the phone.I have an authenticator app on my phone and I just need to touch my watch to approve access to vpn.It's nice.",4,70
So good I had to get another one,"I got one guy my daughters 18th birthday and it was so nice I got a second one for myself! With the price, both were still cheaper than the newest model and we love them!!",5,70
Great Watch,I've really liked this item.It allows me to track my activity during the day and helps me stay active and healthy.I'm able to see my messages without pulling out my phone or even answering my phone.I was hesitant at first to getting this watch but am so happy I got it.,5,71
You gotta get one,Perfect . Need I say more . The white band is fresh. The silver case is dope. And the quality is dumb ditty dumb super fly . You gotta get one foo,5,71
Bought for my gf's birthday. SHE LOVED IT,Amazing qualityRuns perfectlyNo flawsNo lagsNo scratches,5,71
Meh,"Not a great deal.Overly complex and so don’t like having to manually tell the device I have started my workout.Heart rate monitoring is cool.I like it, it is just not as intuitive as I would expect.",3,71
I like extended payment option,So happy with it! This is my second Apple Watch. I had first generation that lasted me 5 years. This has nifty added features. Love it. Great price. Thank you.,5,71
"No issues, looks legit!","Purchased this because it was much cheaper than buying it from the apple store. When I got it, everything looks legit and it works just fine. I decided to buy apple care from the apple store; however, it would not let me because it did not qualify. Luckily four days later I went back and it qualified (not sure why but hey I'm not complaining) and spent $49 for apple care.Recommend this to anyone who does not want to spend the extra money on the apple store!",5,71
Good prices and new apple watch with original packaging,"new and good prices..I am using Samsung Galaxy and apple watch can't be used together..when ordered apple watch I really forgot they can't be used together.very funny...sometimes it's happened when we saw the good prices,so now I just orderediPhone xs and will delivery soon..I hope they can be good together..",5,71
Great,"I use to have a series 1 and it got stolen, so this is an upgrade for me, I love the watch no issues and can’t wait to use it more! :)",5,71
Love it,I love this watch! First off the price on amazon was unbeatable but besides that it’s so useful to me because I’m a hairstylist and I don’t have time to be looking at my phone but Incase I get an important text or call I can easily see it on my wrist! Love love love,5,71
Is it worth the money?,"The watch does what it says and more!! I have always had a Fitbit and was wondering if I was wasting money buying an apple watch, but for what and how often I use my watch, IT'S GREAT!! When you start a workout, the watch automatically tracks it!! If you are or want to be active, I highly recommend investing in a watch like this!!",5,71
Hubby loves it for exercise tracking,Bought this as a gift for my hubby so he could keep up with his workouts.He absolutely loves it.It keeps him encouraged to keep moving.As a diabetic this is important for him.,5,72
Great watch,Bought this watch for my husband as he destroyed his other one after several years. It was a great price and glad amazon had it as most places were sold out.,5,72
iWatch is great gift,"I bought this watch for my wife. It is being sold at a great price right now. Although not the newest model, it has plenty of features for my wife to enjoy.",5,72
It’s good overall, Not what I expected from an Apple Watch but good,5,72
Don’t buy.,The product will not pair. Don’t buy this junk. I spent an hour on the phone with apple and they could not get it to pair either.,1,72
Love it,Don’t know what I’d do with out it is so great. Love the walkie-talkie function!,5,72
Useful,"Love using the watch to track sleep, time of exercise etc!",5,72
Great product<U+0001F44D>,"I should have just gotten one of these, rather than waste my money on the previous 2 fitbits.",4,72
Awesome <U+2600><U+FE0F>,"This watch is amazing I use it everyday but it is easy to scratch so I got a case [2 Packs] Simpeak Screen Protector Cover Case for Apple Watch 38mm, All Around Soft TPU Clear Touch Screen Protector Bumper Cover Case for 38mm Apple Watch Series 2,Series 3, Clear + Plated BlackAmazon'sChoicefor ""apple watch 38mm cover""",5,72
I got mine broken,Alright so I gave this a 4 star because... When I got the watch it wouldn’t want to connect to my phone or anyone else’s phone so I took it to Apple and they need to fix it up so I paid for shipping and I got a broken watch but I know I’m gonna love it when it gets fix. I was really excited to get it but it wasn’t working right<U+0001F614>,3,72
Nice,"This is nice, just got it yesterday. I usually don’t have any trouble with Apple products but for some reason it was difficult to get my notifications to come through on the watch. Other then that I expect typical battery and longevity of any Apple product.",4,73
Disappointing,Integrates well with my iPhone. Battery life sucks. No gps. Relies heavily on iPhone to navigate. Phone mic sucks. Honestly a huge disappointment after having the Garmin Instinct. I’m probably going to throw this in the closet and reorder the Garmin Instinct because even though it doesn’t have a color screen it’s ten times the watch this Apple Watch is. Sorry Apple but you’ve really dropped the ball in too many areas in the smart watch world.,2,73
Great Apple Watch!,This is a great Apple Watch. I had my series 1 since it first came out. I wasn’t planning on getting another one since mine worked great....until it didn’t. This is a great upgrade without costing a fortune.,5,73
It is a great watch.,I originally got this watch to do the walkie talkie with my friends. I like that you can walkie talkie anyone of your friends no matter where you or they are. It’s nice not to have your phone with you and still be able to answer calls or texts.,5,73
Convenient,I'm loving my watch i've been swimming with it which is the main reason for my purchase. It helps aid my breathing when I'm stressed tells me my pulse rate. It even tells me when i'm not as active. i just love it. The band is comfortable the fit was perfect. The only thing i have to do now is purchase a fancy band to wear it when I'm out at events,5,73
2nd apple watch,"I love this watch, I had the other series and there was nothing wrong with it, other than the battery life didn't last long.I decided to get this one because they were reduced and I wanted to upgrade to the next series.",5,73
Defective,Order and received this and it was immediately defective. These are not updated and apple will tell you to send it in for multiple weeks.,1,73
Happy I made the switch to Apple Watch,"I was a Fitbit user for years and years, and finally made the switch. I was afraid it would be complicated, compared to the Fitbit, but it’s easy to figure out, and has way more features. The only downside is the sleep tracking.",5,73
Skeptical at first but pleasantly surprised :),"Came with Apple Watch, charger, small and large bands, and original box. Great condition no scratches , so far works great! The only bad thing was the box had minor scratches.",4,73
MUST BUY!,Absolutely love my Apple Watch! I debated between getting the series 3 or series 5 and in the end I decided to go with series 3 to save money. I love that it comes in the 38mm size because I have really small wrists so anything larger would be too big for my wrist. I’m excited to use this!!,5,73
Worth it!,I never thought I’d want an Apple Watch but you truly don’t know how great having one is until you experience it yourself. I love all the features. It’s stylish and modern. The watch itself is super light weight. Highly recommend getting one!,5,74
Worth it!,"Got this as a gift for my fiancé and he uses it constantly - great for all the apps that sync with his I-phone, step counting, finding his phone when he misplaces it etc.",5,74
Great purchase,"Extremely pleased with my purchase. The price is awesome and 2 day shipping made it even better. This is my 2nd watch, I cracked my screen on the first one and really missed having a Apple Watch. Very happy with my purchase!",5,74
Mostly great.,"I love my watch. It’s taken me a few days to get it all figured out.A con though, I went to the app to look at an exercise I did and saw four exercises from October 2018 (I bought the watch last week.). So basically I think I got a refurbished watch sold at the retail price. I’m not too happy about that but it works fine so I guess that’s a good thing.",4,74
I can’t believe I waited so long to get this watch!!,"I love this Apple Watch!! It really helps me track my exercise and steps throughout the day! Apps can be set up on it as well so I can check weather, music, and more!",5,74
Small cute and does a lot.,"Like the fact that it ad a smaller face had a larger one but lost it. It does everything my other watch did, haven’t found any fault with it as yet.",4,74
Love it!,"I love my apple watch because I'm able to answer and view texts. Unfortunately the battery life of an apple watch is not as long as a fitbit. Overall, I do prefer my apple watch because it can do more than a fitbit.",5,74
wonderful product!,it works great! only complain is it only works with iphone! not even ipad...(,4,74
Do NOT buy!,"My dad has only been using it for a week. Now it doesn’t even charge and we can’t even exchange it. Such an expensive piece and it can’t be used. If I knew it wasn’t going to work, I would rather just buy one new and spent a little more. DO NOT BUY!",1,74
Band will not lock.,The optional long section of the band will not lock into the watch.The shorter section of the band will lock.But the optional larger band section will not lock into the watch no matter what is tried.Called Apple and they will not support.,1,74
good condition :),"so far so good. wonderful condition. this was simple to pair with my iphone, only took 30 mins for me & it’s functioning well. you get to customize the apps and settings by using your watch app on your iphone, which makes things easier. it came charged up too:) *disclaimer* i haven’t had the apple watch for more than a day now, i’ll update my review if anything changes.",5,75
Easy and elegant!,"I love this watch. It tracks everything perfectly. The battery life is great, I do charge it every night when I’m asleep. I love that you can call and text off the watch. It’s fast and so easy to use!",5,75
Just what I was looking for,"The light from the watch when I moved would wake me up in the night. Easy fix. I take the watch off at night to charge, so battery life is never a problem.Love that I can change the band out. Works with my phone. Would recommend.",5,75
Wont pair with a new phone,"I tried to pair it with my iPhone, which is up to date in its software, and it wouldn't connect because the series 3 watch did not have its software up to date. Had to send to apple. I wont have my watch for a couple of weeks.",2,75
On time,This was a Christmas gift. It arrived as scheduled with no issues.,5,75
Affordable,"This watch is perfect if you need a smart watch and also on a budget!! It fits perfect, my iPhone downloaded and set up the watch within 2 minutes, the text is readable and not to mention the sleek packaging it comes in. I would definitely recommend buying this product.",5,75
Perfect,"Very Impressed, watch arrived within 2 days, brand new in apple box. So top marks to seller for sending a brand new product as expected. Works great you can’t ask for better",5,75
good,good,5,75
Great Apple Watch,Bought for my daughter. She loves it. Brand new with box and accessories. Some reviews stated they received a used one with no box. Never had a problem with anything I’ve bought from amazon.,5,75
Great,Was skeptical buying this watch for the price. But when it got here I was pleasantly surprised. And it’s still holding up months later,5,75
Very excited to get this watch,"So far this watch has been fun. I have had it for a month now and feel like I am just breaking into the potential. The activity tracking has been a good boost to be active. Only time will tell if I take advantage of it. Typical Apple watch, but I thought the price was good and the series 3 did all I needed. I scratched the screen pretty easily, so I have put one of the gel screens on to protect from such.",5,76
It’s Apple. Nuff said.,Bought my wife this Apple Watch. A lady at work was trying to big time her with a Fitbit so I decided to back my hunny. Worth the money. It shuts up workplace bullies and has a calculator.,5,76
This is the best thing ever!,"I got the series 3 apple watch about 3 months ago and thanks to it's motivational notifications and the ability to track my workouts and heart rate I have lost 10 pounds! I have the weather, Time and date on my watch face and it is super discrete to receive notifications during a meeting. I recommend an apple watch to anyone who has an apple phone and wants to be healthier.",5,76
Great Christmas gift,Bought this as a Christmas gift Because I loved mine so much. It is a beautiful watch perfect for tracking your daily activities and managing many things from your smartphone!,5,76
Apple is always APPLE,"A very good well built smartwatch for iPhone can only be manufactured by apple itself. I have used Fitbit, Amazfit, Samsung gear sport for apple iPhone, whereas this watch satisfies me and I recommend ONLY apple watch to sync with iPhone. One bad experience I had is with delivery. My delivery date got cancelled twice and got this finally.",4,76
Apple Series 3 Watch 42 mm,This series 3 apple 42 mm watch works perfect and i have had no problems with it at all. Very easy to set up using the apple watch app on the iphone. The speaker and the microphone both sound great. The price on Amazon was very good. I would recommend this Apple Series 3 42 mm Watch. It works so good i am fixing to order another one for my wife.,5,76
Great Apple Watch,Love everything about this watch.I had the Series 1 before and it was easy to transition to the Series 3.Love that it is waterproof.I don't have to worry about it getting wet if I jump in the shower or pool with it.,5,76
Love it, My main concern was the packaging and whether or not someone could tell what was in it due to fear of it being stolen. It was protected with bubble wrap. No damages at all. It came exactly at the time it was estimated to be delivered. Perfect,5,76
Perfect Apple watch for a woman!,Wife is over the moon thrilled with this watch and I am jealous given my series 1 watch has less features then she now has. She loves all the motion/fitness features and the easy of use.,5,76
Charger,I bought this item and my charger stopped working within a month and I am trying to contact the seller and it is making me go through apple. I have been on hold with apple for over an hour when it is said I will be helped in less than 10 minutes. Now I can't use my apple watch because I can't contact apple in order to get my charger. Amazon should have a way of sending me a new charger since I bought it through amazon so that I don't have to go to apple support.,1,76
Amazing upgrade,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he really wanted an Apple Watch after seeing mine. I have a Series 1, and this Series 3 is a hugeeee upgrade over mine. It's so much faster, and the bigger screen is much nicer to look at. I may need to upgrade my watch too!",5,77
As expected,Better than the FitBit it replaces for every thing except sleep tracking.I wear mine every day and have yet to scratch it.Needs about an hour daily to charge fully.,5,77
Great update,"Love the long battery life.It seems to have increased sensitivity to steps, heart rate and sleep. Perfect upgrade without the huge expense <U+2764><U+FE0F>",5,77
Love it,I love my Apple Watch.It has done everything I wanted and more.I love that you can receive and reply to texts on it and that I can find my iPhone when I misplace it.It’s a great addition to my Apple family.,5,77
Works so well I bought 2,"Perfectly tracks my running with the Nike run app. Other than that I only use it as a watch, and in that capacity it works well.GPS tracking works good even away from the phone, which is good because I like to empty my pockets before a run. Bought a second for my wife when it was on prime day sale. I’ve worn it daily for at least 6 months and had no problems whatsoever. Battery lasts more than 2 days which is fine because the longest I’m ever away from it’s charger is around that.",5,77
Still must have if you are an iPhone user,Sleep tracking is not included. Battery life is for one day. But still a very useful watch. I bought a used one for my wife and she is happy with it.,5,77
Great Watch,"What else is there to say, Apple's products are superior!",5,77
No Complaints,I was looking into the Fitbit Versa for over a year as I thought buying an Apple Watch would be way out of my price range. During the bloc Friday sales the watch was $20 more than the sales price of a Versa and well worth it.The Versa is not compatible to answer calls or receiving notifications from your iPhone.Of course the Apple Watch does and it even vibrates on my wrist for the reminders from my phone which is a tremendous help!!!,5,77
Nice,"I bought this as a gift, my brother loves the gift! Would purchase again!",5,77
16 yr old approved!,I don't know anything about apple products. Bought the watch for my 16 yr old. She loves it and said everything checked out. I literally ordered on Friday and received on Sunday!Super fast shipping.,5,77
My Wife Loves it!,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday. She now wears it pretty much at all times and tracks her steps, her sleep, uses apps. I can't wear a watch to work or I would totally buy a second one for myself.",5,78
"It’s great, but it’s not fantastic.","I’m honestly a little disappointed that there seems to be no changes to the watch from the first series, which is what I had before, but well that’s fine, the watch does a lot of fun things and I enjoy it. The main thing that annoys me is pretty arbitrary: Apple seriously needs more watch faces!! A corporation of this size and capability should be able to produce more than 110 faces (and some of these are the same just different colors)!",5,78
Best Deal!,"I really love this for keeping track of my workouts and health and for this to only be about 2 years old, the price was awesome! The new ones are cool but there’s not a HUGE difference between this and the series 4 except the price. As a college student, I’d recommend it especially if you’re already in the Apple ecosystem and want to keep track of things like health and having little alerts without always being on your phone.",5,78
Yay,I got my watch yesterday and it’s not updated and I can’t pair my phone to update it and you can’t update it without pairing it,1,78
This is the best.,I love it. I upgraded from the first gen and I won’t look back.,5,78
Love it,Absolutely love this watch!!! Best investment!!!!,5,78
Love it!!!,"Came in perfect condition, looked like I just purchased it from the apple store. Still wear it and use it everyday. It goes with every outfit and is water resistant so I don’t have to worry about taking it off.",5,78
Fantastic watch.,I was a little hesitant because I did not know much about these watches. I gotta tell y’all that this is GOLD standard. This watch is amazing. So happy I decided to purchase one.,5,78
Battery failed after 3 weeks,The product failed after three weeks. We now have to journey to an Apple Store for them to potentially fix it or send it away.This was an expensive gift for my daughter's graduation. The whole celebration has now been marred.Waste of everyone's time.,1,78
Apple Watch Series 3,"This is my first Apple Watch. I’ve had Fitbits prior to this purchase. Overall, I’ve been pleased with this Apple Watch. The only negative comment I have is that the battery life is about 3 days, whereas my Fitbit lasted 5-7 days. It does come with a magnetic charger, which is definitely easier than trying to connect some of the Fitbit chargers.",5,78
Be careful this Apple Watch will not work with iPhone 6+.,Warning: This watch will not work with iPhone 6+. You must have iPhone 6s.Much old information posted out there is just wrong. You must upgrade to a least iPhone 6s or 7.Very disappointed with Apple.,3,79
Great overall watch for the price.,"Works great I use it for working out every day. It tracks my steps , calories burned and distance I have traveled. GPS unteathered feature is awesome as they have maps that you can download and it will show you where exactly where you are on the map on your watch. The battery is great I get a full 2 days use out of it while in use.",5,79
Love it!!,I love this watch so much from the beautiful design to the fun features it comes with! I’m a student and this watch is very helpful because it helps me track my heart rate to make sure I’m not overly stressed and it tells me to breath at random times which helps me with stress too. Overall this is a great product and an even better one for students!,5,79
Good to teach your exercise goals,"I never used the sleep tracking. The best part is using it for exercise, finding my phone, and answering it when your phone was not around",5,79
Easy to use,Cool product but I realized I'm not a watch person and having a big chunk of metal on my wrist just made me feel odd.But the product is good and would suggest it to anyone that loves electronics.Only problem now is waiting on the refund to kick in.It's been more than 7 days and I still haven't received any information on refund when I see the package was delivered.,3,79
Great watch,"Switched from a Fitbit Ionic to the Apple Watch. I had better sleep insights in and all in one app with the Fitbit, but love the overall connectivity of devices with the Apple.",5,79
"Great battery life , easy to use",First day having it and it’s perfect so far. I needed a watch for when I’m busy at work and need to send a quick reply when I get a text or be able to answer if there’s an emergency.,5,79
Love it!,"I have only had this a few days and I love it. I am using it a lot and even for sleep tracking so I was concerned with battery life. Not only does the battery last a lot longer than I expected, it charges even faster!",5,79
The band doesn’t stay on very well,I went swimming with this thing in the river one time and the band came undone. It does not stay on very well at all. Now I’m out a watch,1,79
Bought as a gift,"She loves her watch. It does a great job tracking activity, however I haven’t found an option to track sleep. Everything I’ve seen are paid apps. That’s not a big deal, but seems odd to charge so much when there are other options available that do all",4,79
Most user friendly watch for those on the go <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FD>,Love love love my watch! So much better days since I have it. Syncs with all my apple products so makes life much smoother.It does seems to lose charge faster with more activity but I guess that’s to be expected. I’d buy another one any day and for friends and family too. Also enjoy how the screen savers are so diverse and I can even use my personal photos as well.,5,80
I love it,"I love it, I took a long time thinking and wondering if I needed one being that I have a bunch of watches with dead batteries, but I love love love it",5,80
Great Apple Watch!,"This Apple Watch is original and exactly as described. It comes in a sealed original box with the charger included. I had lost my previous series two and I was a little hesitant cause I thought maybe this watch would be used or damaged, but it was brand new and in perfect condition. I definitely recommend!",5,80
You get what you pay for.,"Hasn’t worked properly since the day we got it and despite the fact that we’ve talked to multiple tech support reps over the last 6 months to restart the watch they still won’t replace it. Don’t buy from Amazon, just buy it from an Apple store so you have the proper warranty and tech support in place.",1,80
YOU NEED THIS!,This one is amazing!!!<U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>,5,80
PERFECT!!!! Love it!!!,"I bought the 42 for my sister with a very small wrist. She loves it! Synced right up with her iPhone SE. Works great! I will say the description said the adapter was included but it wasn’t. Just so you know to be prepared for that. Overall great! Packaged great, arrived on time too!",5,80
Good Price,"This phone is sold at a good price and has good apps/features. However, the main reason I wanted this phone was to be active and track my runs. I learned you have to have your phone with you at all times if you want to play music, which is a deal breaker for me. I have Spotify and hate that I can't download music to my phone. I really liked the watch just not willing to keep my phone on me while I run and bike.",3,80
"This watch is great, very convenient in the gym","My wrists are small so I chose 38mm, and it fits well. This watch is great, very convenient in the gym. I carry it daily and the battery is very good.",5,80
Awesome product,My husband absolutely loves his watch. It doesn’t come with a screen protector so we had to buy that separate.,5,80
Great watch,Exactly what I was wanting!It comes with the cord but not the cube charger.I use usb to charge anyway so not a issue.My daughter bought hers directly from Apple and she received same cord and no cube .charger. And warranty is with Apple,5,80
I love my watch!,"My fitbit died and I decided to pick up one of these as a replacement. I can't express how much this blows my old fitbit out of the water. It's easy to use, it tracks everything, and as a bonus, it gives me my notifications so I don't always need my phone with me.Love it!",5,81
Perfect!,Birthday present for mom.It’s perfect!Arrived still sealed in its original package.The watch is flawless with zero scuffs and scratches.,5,81
Great buy.,As my first smart watch. I love everything about this. The price is good. It does everything. The speaker is good and The voice to text is much better than my phones voice to text. I went with the 33mm and it fits my wrist well. any bigger and it would hit into everything.,5,81
Not brand new,Received my Apple Watch and it was not brand new it was connected to someone else’s Apple ID wasn’t able to use had to get it replaced,2,81
Came quick!,"It came quick in the mail for a great price. Works as intended, comes as its supposed to. It even came in packaging that makes it look like a normal package - I was slightly worried about how it would deliver just because of it being an apple watch and an item that could be potentially stolen but didn't have to worry about it!",5,81
Great smart watch! I love it,"I’ve always wanted an Apple Watch and this one exceeds my expectations. You won’t realize that you needed one until it’s on your wrist, then you can’t live with out it.",5,81
"excelente producto, llego rápido","me encanto , llego en perfectas condiciones agregué la protección por 2 años porque el anterior lo perdí por un golpe en la pantalla y, le compré el estuche para la pantalla!",5,81
It's a great gift!,"I bought this Apple Watch for my girlfriend's birthday. She LOVED it. Every single feature, the battery, the compatibility, everything. However, for some reason, she is getting some allergic reactions with the band the Apple Watch came with. I dont know if it is just her or the band does give you some kind of reaction when you use it for longer periods of time. Other than that, she is completely happy with it.",5,81
Why did I wait to so long to buy an Apple Watch,"Great buy. Sync well with my iPhone 6s. I can answer and make calls [and much more] from my watch just as long as my phone is near buy. The activity rings motivates you to be active. I wouldn’t get any other watch or fitness tracker, if I am a iPhone user. The compatibility cannot be beat. One last thing, I can go almost 2.5 days without charging my watch.",5,81
"Authentic, teen loves it.","Battery life seems to be normal.She wears and uses it all day, charges at night.Series 3, does as expected. Came with white band.",5,81
Decent upgrade from my series 1,Came from a series 1 and this series 3 is much faster and responsive. Before my messages wouldn't sync to the watch which was very frustrating and now they come in as soon as they come in on my phone.,5,82
Apple Watch series 3 will not stay on during day,This entire experience has been horrible! Have had the Apple Watch series 3 less than 2 months. Bought brand new. It is constantly shutting down and losing charge 3-4 times a day. I have spent hours on the phone with amazon support and apple and the only options I am getting is I either pay $235 to mail it in to be fixed or I have to take it an hr away to an authorized apple repair place. This is very sad since it was just bought brand new. In my opinion I should be sent a new product <U+0001F621>,1,82
Great watch.,Love this watch. I barely take it off. The battery lasts all day and charges very fast. I like to use it to monitor my sleep and it seems to do a very good job at it.,5,82
Great while it lasted,Loved this while it lasted. The watch just stopped working and I haven’t even had it 2 years. Used it everyday but took great care of it so very disappointing that It didn’tlast longer,3,82
Greatest thing for the iPhone <U+2764><U+FE0F>,I use this at work every day and it’s pretty awesome! Great to have when you need to quick glance at things and can’t pick up your phone,5,82
Same as in the store,I love amazon so when i went on here looking for an apple watch I was pleased to see the discount and was excited to purchase. The packaging and everything was perfect came in a box that was a little skeptical compared to others but it had the same thing in the box as an Apple Watch you’d get out of the apple store. Only thing is it didn’t come with a charging box. Everything else was in the box.,5,82
Doesn’t charge well. Seems to be refurbished?,Never charges to 100% on its own. Have to pick up and put on 4 times for full charge. Doesn’t include charger blocker so I bought an Apple one and it still doesn’t work. Doesn’t work normally on other friends’ chargers. Spent $100 on accessories and it won’t even charge correctly. 5/5 regret buying it,1,82
Love it!,"I am an Apple fan and decided to upgrade my old Iwatch for this one.Main improvement is battery life.As usual in an Apple product, excellent quality.",5,82
Great product!,"My husband loves his watch! It does everything he hoped for and more. He can communicate with his phone, answer calls, check messages and texts. It tracks his physical activity including sleep. Battery is typical of apple products and it lasts him through the day wo recharging.",5,82
Really nice watch,I really recommended for the price. Is the same you got at the Apple web store. When I got it it was new at all. I used with my iPhone everyday and I had no issue. Such a really good inversion,5,82
great tracking,I like the fact that I track my movement for steps and exercises plus if I want my sleep and get notifications for msgs and emails and that I can replay via my watch .I do wish the battery life was longer but charging it first thing in the morning works well.,5,83
love it,use it mostly for health/fitness tracking. I know there are a ton of features that i dont take advantage of but everything i've tried or use is great. Havent had any issues with it yet.,5,83
Awesome watch,Good for the price ! My husband and I just got new I phones but I didn’t wanna pay a lot for the I watch so I got this one on here it works great and does a lot of things I prefer it over any Fitbit ! It was cheaper then a Fitbit when I bought it on here too.,5,83
As described.,Father’s Day gift for hubby. He loves it and is not techno savvy. Learned to use itvery quickly. Never boasts about gifts but does boast about his new watch.,5,83
Good price and love how it tracks my fitness. Really happy with the buy.,Arrived shrink-wrapped in a timely manner. I’m loving it already. Working great. Just used it for my first time at the gym today and it helped me push a lot harder than I had in a while.,5,83
Best purchase ever,Works perfectly! I switched from a Fitbit blaze to this. It does way more of what I need. Especially love that I can answer calls and respond to messages from it.,5,83
Great product,Legitimate Apple Watch and works as it should,5,83
Totally worth it!!!!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas rather than going to our carrier and we couldn’t be happier! It’s great quality and exactly what it should be! I actually just reordered last night for myself except I bought the white band one this time around!,5,83
Very good,Bought this watch for my father on Father’s Day but I used it for a week to test it out. I’m now buying another because this watch is so useful and easy to use. My father has told me he really enjoys it too.,5,83
Purchase,Great purchase.Very fast arrival.,5,83
Do not order,It worked for 1 DAY (sort of) and would not record steps or sleep after first day.I should have respected the reviews... and now Amazon is charging me 30% for restocking fee!! What a joke! Do not order.,1,84
Great watch!!,I am now checking my steps on this watch. There are so many good reasons to have this watch! Very pleased and easy to use. I can check for messages heart rate etc.,5,84
Great Improvement!,Love this watch! I had an Apple 1 and upgrading to the 3 was perfect. I find a longer battery life and the faster movement between apps and the functionality of the watch is great!,5,84
Happy with Apple watch series 3,"This watch was easy to set up. The layout of multiple apps is nice and makes it easy to find. I can text, answer my phone, even receive pictures on my watch. Very happy with this purchase.",5,84
Love it,"I love this watch. I helps me track my exercise time, the calories burned. It’s makes it easy to see where I stand at the end of the week and work towards my goals. The best feature is it locates my Phone that probably lying around somewhere underneath the heap of papers or clothes <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>",5,84
Happy with my purchase,I bought this for tracking my lap swims and have found it useful for so much more.,5,84
Buy it,"Very good, and cheap!",5,84
Cute,Cute,5,84
Excellent!!! A+++ on service and item<U+23F1> !!! <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB><U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> We <U+2764><U+FE0F>It!!!,My Son <U+2764><U+FE0F> It!,5,84
Not for me,"I had a Fitbit in the past and was hoping this would track more details, like floors and sleep.. you need to download a separate app for sleep. It was just a tiny phone on my wrist, not what I was looking for.",3,84
Smart watch,It is good but the watch dies too fast I just charged it last night and I am already at 52 percent of battery life,5,85
Great Deal,So happy I was able to get this at such a great price. Made it much easier to purchase and upgrade from a fitbit. Love how it can track your exercise so easily. It motivates me to get in a quick workout daily to be consistent!!,5,85
What I needed,I have been pleasantly pleased with this watch. It arrived brand new in the original packaging. The only thing I don’t like is that the bands are difficult to change.,5,85
Awesome watch,"Perfect, keeps me motivated to get up and move. Don’t know why I waited so long to buy.Was worried about buys since it was a 3 series but it absolutely working for me.",5,85
Happy watching,Don’t know how I lived with our one!!! Love my watch.,5,85
No issues,Bought this for my daughter. She loves it,5,85
Great product.,"This is so perfect. The price is very reasonable, you see a lot of people trying to sell theirs for more than what this seller is. Hands down the purchase I’ve made.",5,85
Poor battery life,Watch is less than 6 months old and the battery is dying before the end of the day.Too new to be draining so fast especially when I don’t use a lot of apps.,3,85
AMAZING!,"This thing is a lifesaver for me! I can Never keep up with my phone so this has been great. It keep up with my sleep, heart rate, where my real phone is and so many other things are. Amazing!",5,85
Series 3 is by far the best series,"I love everything about this watch! I had the 42mm but my screen cracked and it cost way too much to get it fixed ($210) the same amount I paid for a brand new watch, just downgrade in size, which is fine with me. The watch came with a S/M band and a M/L band and with the charging cable but not the power block. (I’m sure if you owned a few iPhones, you should have a old block laying around) Be sure to get AppleCare+ or insurance through your carrier within 30 days I believe or else you’ll end up like me buying a completely new watch!!!",5,85
nice watch,Im happy with this watch. The price is good considering the comparable fit bit watch costs just as much and I would rather have an apple product.,4,86
BRAND NEW!!,The Watch came in Brand New in Original packaging. It also came sooner than expected.,5,86
Buy it now!!! Great deal!,"Bought this for my sisters 17th birthday and she absolutely loves it!!! She loves the sleep tracker, the activity tracking, texting on it and playing mini games on it!! She loves it! I was skeptical at first purchasing an Apple Watch from amazon but I was proven wrong when it arrived! I’m gonna have to order one for myself!",5,86
I love it!,I upgraded to an Apple Watch from a Fitbit Charge 2 and wish I would’ve done it sooner. I absolutely love my watch. It’s worth it!,5,86
I Recommend this Product,I have always used Apple products and I recommend them to a lot of people. My second generation screen broke off so I bought this one to replace it. Works great and paired easily. I recommend this product to anyone wanting a watch or upgrading.,5,86
Amazing,Very great can almost go up to two full days without charging. I have swam in lakes and pools and have had no problems with the battery or watch in general having problems. Great for encouraging to be more active!,5,86
Forever watch,So in love with my watch!I’ve gone through 4 Fitbits and they are aweful bc they do not last <U+0001F621>Glad I got an Apple Watch,5,86
Works for me,"I can Ping my phone when it's misplaced, and it unlocks my MacAir. Also I can answer my phone when I'm not close by to pick it up.",5,86
Gran calidad,Gran diseño y calidad,5,86
Wife loves it,"My wife really likes it - Made changes in her daily routine to make the watch ""happy"" lol. All about hitting daily goals",5,86
Works better than I ever expected,"I am truly loving my Apple Watch. I was hesitant due to many of the reviews I read, but so far it has not let me down and the battery lasts longer than expected. I am so glad I took the plunge and purchased one.",5,87
Break down and get yourself one. You deserve it,I am in love with this product. I waited a long time to get one. I am completely satisfied and it does so much for me. I really like the fact that I don’t have to reach into my pocket or purse from my phone.,5,87
Received my new Apple Watch ahead of schedule!,Since I broke my old Apple Watch I was lost without it.Quick delivery was a plus.Good job!,5,87
Big ole hairy peter,This is better than a series 5 for battery life it’s just a little bit smaller than the 44mm series 5 that I returned this for now I’m wishing I’d have kept it,5,87
Good and easy to use,It is more convenient to use and it is a must have now that I bought it. It helps with fitness a lot and ever since I got this watch I can't stop using it for convenience. I like how we can make phone calls from the watch or receive calls so it's easier.,5,87
Love it,Love it I had the series 1 but wanted an upgrade and this watch fits the bill perfectly. Great price and highly recommended,5,87
Apple “watch” is everything you can ask for<U+2763><U+FE0F>,"I love it, it’s my upgrade from my “Fitbit”....still learning about ALL the functions, but it’s really amazing<U+0001F44D><U+0001F602><U+0001F609><U+2763><U+FE0F>",5,87
If I could have found another one I would have,It was pretty banged up. I get it was refurbished but didn’t expect it to have that much damage,2,87
Becare full,I’m pretty sure it a great watch but I can’t pair at all now I have to go apple and see what’s going on.I have an iPhone XR and the watch just doesn’t pair and idk know whyDisappointed in that can’t even use it,2,87
Amazing!,Originally bought a Fitbit versa 2 and that sucked so I returned it and got this and absolutely love it I definitely recommend it it’s absolutely amazing and I’m so happy with my purchase,5,87
Not gonna lie...,"For the first couple of days... it could not even stay on for half a day. It was beautiful, just like new... if not new. However, it just kept dying?? I was going to return it. Eventually I let it slide for a few more days, and it's completely fine now. I'm slightly active ( walks, swims 300+yards, jogging, and biking) I can use it all day and even have about 45% at the end of the night.",4,88
Lasting battery,So far so good. I’ve been wanting an Apple Watch for so long to track my steps and be there while I’m at work and can’t use my phone. I wake up at 9am and sometimes I don’t make it home until 8 my watch still had a 80% battery when I made it. Only con is I didn’t get a wall box for my charger but that’s fine.,5,88
I recommend this product,This is a great product especially for the price I strongly recommended the only problem that I have ever had is the fact that the battery life only last one day,5,88
Horrible Apple Experience and Customer Service,The Apple Watch overheated and it was so hot when I picked it up that I had to let go of it. It made a tiny scratch on the corner and Apple refused to repair it without me covering the cost of the glass(which was basically the cost of the watch) before they looked into the defective issue. Apple is horrible at responding to issues their products have and will find ways to make you cover the cost when it’s still in warranty.,1,88
Pairs beautifully with dexcom,My husband is a type one diabetic and needed something that can easily show his blood sugar and connect to his dexcom. This has worked wonderfully and he loves it!!,5,88
Long time coming,"It has been a long time coming , I’ve put it off enough and after finally making the purchase I am nowhere short of disappointed. All the way around a spectacular watch. I made a few personal upgrades but still an outstanding and highly recommended piece of tech.",5,88
Love!,Love the activity tracker and mobile access to messages and calls!,5,88
Good investment,My girl loves it! And it’s pretty as heck. So I’m happy with it especially with what I paid for it on Black Friday.,5,88
Great tracker,I bought this for myself to track my sleep and steps daily. I like how it shows how your heart rate dips while sleeping. The band is slightly uncomfortable,5,88
Great birthday gift,My husband love this watch for his birthday. He was totally surprised and happy. The watch synced to his iPhone immediately. Great buy!,5,88
BUY IT!!!!,I was so iffy on getting an Apple Watch from amazon.. but YES IT IS LEGIT AND I LOVE IT! It came packaged SUPER well! And everything was sealed! I’m so happy with it!,5,89
Great watch and well worth the money,I've had no issues out of this watch it paired with my phone without issues. And worked like it was brand new. It was worth every penny,5,89
Felt naked without it <U+0001F602>,Owned one when the series 3 first came out ... dropped the sucker on tile floor and shattered the glass and I didn’t want to pay the price of a series 4.,5,89
Love this watch,Not sure how I lived without one of these. It's great for exercise tracking and quickly checking messages without having to pull your phone out. I highly recommend it for anyone with an iPhone.,5,89
Great watch!,I love this watch! It keeps track of your activities and is a great alarm clock! I love how you can have your phone on silent and search for it through the watch! You can also receive notifications and see who is calling and or texting you without taking your phone out! Would definitely recommend and would definitely purchase again!,5,89
Great watch,Was kinda scared to purchase this but it’s a great watch so far. Everything works great and was super easy to set up!,5,89
Still the best!,"Brand new for the same price as a screen repair of my Series 1. Looks beautiful and works great. Very fast, waterproof, and upgraded GPS. Still the best tech value around.",5,89
Love it!,Love my Apple Watch! I'm very happy with this purchase. It's great for tracking my stepsister and workouts and having it synced with my phone using WiFi makes life easier.,5,89
Great for fitness tracking and basic messages,Few products exceed my expectations. Even though people have been raving about the apple watch for a while. I was impressed and delighted.,5,89
Great value compared to the 4 and 5.,Have really enjoyed using this watch. Finding more uses as I continue to use it. Battery life easily gets me through the day.,4,89
Watch did not pair,This watch would not paired. I tried every conceivable solution. I ended up buying another watch directly from apple for more money but the watch from apple paired immediately. Lesson learned. Trying to return this iwatch was a hassle as I had to go through a technician who tried telling me they need to go through the manufacturer. The return request was 2 days after received well within the window.,1,90
It cracked,My watch cracked without be doing anything to it to crack it. It then stopped working and apple was not able to fix it. The warranty does not do enough and there is no refund or any way to fix the watch. I now have to buy a new one because of this.,1,90
Love love love!,Overall it’s a really good product. Battery lasts like a day. I got it mainly to track and record my workouts and it’s great! Way better than a Fitbit and it works good with my iPhone. Do yourself a favor and get this if you workout a lot!,5,90
Perfect Condition!!!,Excellent!!! Works Perfectly! I’ve been wearing it for almost a week. No Problems at all. Even came in original apple box. LOVE <U+2764><U+FE0F>,5,90
Watch is fragile,I give Amazon 5 stars for replacing my watch. I give Apple 3 stars. The watch isn't for people that work hard with their hands. The watch is very fragile and the face scratches and cracks easily.,3,90
Disappointed,"I wanted an Apple Watch to use it specially when Im working out, I found this one and bought it because was cheaper than the others. At the beginning it was working good but now I don’t know why it’s so slow and it doesn’t show me the information of my work out in real time",2,90
Great watch,", I love the instant notification of calls and messages , because it is on my wrist.Not a fan of the home screen with all the application icons. Very confusing to my wife.",5,90
"Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS, 42mm)",I was doing some test and the battery went off in less than one day. So it's better if you charges every night.,5,90
There was no watch in my box!!!!!!!,there was no actually watch attachment in my box. just the band and charger. what a rip. I want my money back.,1,90
Great watch great price and fast shipping.,"My phone was arrived the next day, although usps didn’t deliver until the third day which is not the seller’s fault. I just got it this morning so far soo good I love it! I used it to do my walk I can track my walk all day unlike my iPhone I had to hold my phone all the time to track down my steps for the day. I can check my messages, whatsup, listen to my music or podcast and more. Thank you.",5,90
Nice new AppleWatch,Brand new in plastic wrapped AppleWatch box. Got it a day earlier than scheduled. Can’t beat that!,5,91
Great watch!,"Love this watch! Only complain is that the battery life is only one or two days however it charges from zero to full in an hour so that makes up for it since it’s so fast to charge.Have had no glitches, love the band it cleans up real easy and the screen is really strong and durable.",5,91
Excellent,"Used for workouts, texts, phone calls, temps,activity measurement,Heartline survey, and of course - a watch.",5,91
Best watch ever,I love my watch. It motivates me to keep moving. I love tracking my walks.,5,91
You won’t be disappointed.,Absolutely love it. Wasn’t quite sure what to expect and was a tad reluctant to become an Apple Watch user but I’m sold now. Powered right on and paired quickly with my iPhone 11. Will definitely be buying the 42 mm for my husband.,4,91
Lasted 6 months,Face piece detached in March 2020 after less than 6 months of useThe screen wasn’t cracked though. It was due to a “swollen” battery from charging it every night.It actually still works. I just wouldn’t dare wear it again. Expensive useless unwearable tech.,1,91
You’ll fall in love instantly. :),"I have just received the watch. It fits my wrist nicely, I have small hands and it compliments my wrist well (38). I am enjoying the apps and the activity tracker, which was the main reason I bought it. I am still messing with the features and will update later on after a week or so. If you are hesitant to buy it you’re definitely missing out. The price is perfect and the product is legit. Treat yourself! I’m so happy I did.",5,91
Great watch!,"I’ve been using this for 2 months now and it is very helpful tracking my daily activities such as walking, hiking and i can see all my notifications at once.",5,91
Great overall,Love it so much and just love the fact that I don’t need my phone near me to be able to see who is calling and texting and being able to answer from the watch as well.,5,91
Great exercise and health tracker,"Love all the apps this watch can have! Really helps to keep track of all my activities, nutrition and health related apps",5,91
Impressed!,"This is amazing! It came perfectly in a sealed box like all Apple products do. Setup was easy! This is the same product that Best Buy sells but $30 lower than them! 10/10 I recommend! Get this watch if you want a simple smart watch, it is worth the money:)",5,92
Worth the money and food watch,I love it!!! Came on time it came earlier than when it was suppose to because it said it will arrive Monday by 9pm and it came like 1 in the afternoon. Other than that I love it and just remember to put on power reserve but the battery is good. Thank you!!! Way better than ordering from eBay.,5,92
Dependable,"This is my second Apple Watch. I absolutely love it!Use it every day for physical fitness workouts, calorie tracking, heart rate, text messaging, phone calls.",5,92
Love it,I was skeptic after reading some reviews on other apple watches on amazon. However mines is working like a charm it looks brand new. The battery life is great and over all functions work properly.,5,92
Love it,Been wanting an Apple Watch and finally splurged and I’m so glad I did. And it’s comfortable to wear. Does everything i want it to,5,92
She loves her watch,My daughter loves it. She got it for Christmas.,5,92
Wonderful,"Shipping was fast, the watch is great too.",5,92
Good price,"I like it for workouts,checking my sleep patterns. Doesn’t seem to stay charged as long as I thought it would. I believe it says up to four days I get maybe two days out of a charge",4,92
Great product fast delivery,Great overall product,5,92
Awesome!,"Sealed box, all the accesories inside. I bought it 3 months ago and i love it!",5,92
Great product,"So much cheaper than Apple store itself. Works amazing . Haven’t had any problems and it’s been more than a month. Great battery life usually last more than a day or two , but never let it die out . Great workout apps as well",5,93
Best watch I’ve owned,Great watch! Perfect for everything I need! Idk if it sleep tracks I actually don’t use it at night but it charges in 2 hours and lasts for 2 days depending on how much you use the watch! I’d suggest setting the watch so the face does light up every time you lift your hand. Unless you want that<U+0001F643>,5,93
Screen popped out and cracked on its own after 8 months of owning,"I am so disappointed, I spent nearly two hundred dollars on this item. It worked great up until last night when I was laying in bed. The screen popped out of the watch on its own causing the screen to crack. It completely stopped working and will not turn back on. I tried to find a product support email, but apparently Apple does not have one. I have only owned this product for about 8 months.",1,93
Good deal and great gift,Got a great deal on this one I Black Friday. Wasn’t sure I would like it or find uses for it. After a few weeks I have completely gotten rid of my Fitbit. This does so much more. Love it.,5,93
Love it!,I love my watch and I wear it everyday except when I’m sleeping! I have small wrists and it fits perfectly!,5,93
Love it,Love it,5,93
Good product,Really good product for being 2 generations old thought I needed the 40 but the 38 looks better I think the 40 would have been too big. If your a woman with a small wrist that’s just looking for a nice watch that mimics everything your phone does that I would recommend buying this product.,4,93
Perfect,I bought for gift and he loves thanks,5,93
"No watch, empty box","Box was empty and didn’t receive Any watch, so frustrating and literally shocked",1,93
Apple Watch,"Bought myself this for my birthday back in March. I love my watch so much, between all the functions I can perform on it and I can change the band on the watch which I think is cool. Overall, I have been very satisfied with the watch",5,93
Great watch hit or miss on the charger,"Watch works great but my biggest complaint with this product was that my charger went bad 8 months after ordering it. It stayed on my night stand, I never traveled with it so I did not understand why it went bad. Apple would not replace it because it was past 6 months. That would be great if you guys would be willing to replace my charger.",4,94
Great price for a great watch,"Only thing that sucks about Apple watches is you canfind your phone By pressing a button on your watch, but you can’t find your watch by pressing a button on your phone.So that’s a little disappointing to me. Otherwise, I like it a lot!",4,94
Very convenient,It’s such a handy little tool love it.,5,94
Amazing!,"I love this watch! I ordered separate bands but the white one is nice as well. When I first saw this I was skeptical and ran to the reviews, but after hours of scrolling through I decided to go for it and couldn’t be happier with the outcome. It works perfectly in the short amount of time I’ve had it (got it today). Took a second to figure it out and I can already tell it’s worth the money!",5,94
Love this watch,"Can’t live without, my old one finally broke after 4 1/2 years so I got to upgrade and I’m so glad I did.",5,94
Affordable. Great buy.,I haven’t used it for sleep tracking but honestly I loved that I bought this Apple Watch even though You probably will need to charge it every night. It was super affordable for the size of the screen.,5,94
Great Buy,"Great for what I use it for. THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS (saying it louder for the people in the back). Just charge everyday, I have no idea how it drains so quickly. But love everything else about it!",5,94
Buy it. You won’t regret it.,This watch has changed my life. I no longer have to search tirelessly for my phone. I just ping it.,5,94
I LOVE IT,i’m a figure skater and this has changed my life on the ice and with training! i love the tracking features and it has really changed how i work out! it’s also provided a lot of motivation to keep working hard!!!,5,94
I like it,It’s great,5,94
Very nice but if you’re a man like me order the 42mm,"Very good was suspicious about it being on amazon but it was brand new from apple, very easy to use but if you’re a grown man the 38mm is going to be too small for you. But overall it’s a very good watch can call and text as long as your phone is near! It also doesn’t come with a box but I have my old apple boxes so no problem, and comes with a small band and an extra M/L band in the box.",5,95
BEWARE!!,Shaking my head!! If I could give 0 stars I would.This Apple Watch was supposed to be “NEW” yet still it has a problem pairing to my IPhone 8plus.Spent over a hour on the phone with the amazon and apple reps.,1,95
Definitely worth every penny!!!! I love my new Apple Watch!!!,I revived my Apple Watch on Monday an it was just like I went to the apple store and purchased it. It was neatly packaged with everything I needed inside. It was super easy to set up an it works an looks great. Definitely worth every penny. I am still finding out new things that my watch can do it’s amazing. I am extremely happy with my purchase!!!! Thank you so much!!!,5,95
Nice upgrade from the series 1,"This is faster and is water resistant, so a nice upgrade without paying a lot for the higher level models",5,95
Happy happy,It came in super fast 3 days I think..in this pandemic ya'll came thru..ty ty so happy,5,95
Really fun,Really like this watch. The band is so comfortable and really stays put. I bought one for my 12 year old and it fits her small wrist too. Changing out the bands is so fun and easy.,5,95
Apple has everything on this watch!!,I love every function!<U+0001F60A>,5,95
Great Apple Watch!!!,"This watch has changed my life, I don't remember life before it, it is such a wonderful aid to getting things done while on th go, my favorite thing is to track my workouts my heart rate my speed... a must have indeed!!",5,95
Good to go with your Iphone,This is a good watch if you are a Iphone user.I liked the features and keeps me active.However if you are looking at a Fitness watch this is not for you.I have owned a Fitbit before and I feel that Fitbit was a very active watch and great with sending notifications.iWatch is a companion so if you dont wanna carry your phone this should be Ok.,4,95
"Great buy, dies kinda fast for a watch",Battery dies kinda quick for just having it fully charged and dying in one day but it looks slick and clean,4,95
Love!!,I love this watch! I’m so glad I finally got an Apple Watch!This was perfect and does everything I need it to.,5,96
Comes with original box and plastic wrap,It was delivered quickly like it said . The product came in new and wrapped in its box with the original plastic. I’m in love with my Apple Watch! I highly recommend!,5,96
10-Oct,Just got my watch today and I’m entirely impressed! If you don’t have an Apple Watch you’re really missing out on life to be honest! Definitely would recommend this watch and seller!,5,96
Love it!!,"I am new to Apple products with the exception of an iPad. I have been an Android user for many years and never thought I would change.I recently got an iPhone so my family thought it fitting to get me an Apple watch for Mother's Day.I love my watch -- I am still learning all of its functions and how to work them, but I absolutely love my watch!!",5,96
Wow,"I love it. It arrived brand new, so easy to use and now I couldn’t go to work without it as I always check the activity and my heart beat. I can easily read those who message me via sms or other social media networks. I bought the 38mm cmbecause I’m skinny and I’m glad I did. Fits perfect.",5,96
Great buy,My honey and myself love ours. I love the walkie talkie feature when I lose my husband in the store.,5,96
Worth the money! I love it,"Dies a little quick maybe cause I’m on it all the time <U+0001F602> but good purchase! Came quick was in original Apple box, came with everything. Good purchase I love it!!",5,96
Nice product great price,Bought for my girlfriend she loves it! Amazon logistics did not deliver it to my door but when I called them they made it right! Price was great too,5,96
You’ll love it!,"I absolutely love my watch! I was told by a friend it was on sale and couldn’t help but buy it! I’ve had it for around a month and it was the best purchase I have made, honestly. I switched from Fitbit to Apple and I’m never going back!!",5,96
Apple needs to make the screen more durable,I love having a Apple Watch but what i don’t like is that the screen cracks really easily I’ve had 3 of them this past year. And to get a new screen cost the same as buying a new Apple Watch it’s ridiculous.,2,96
Great watch :),"I love that it charges fast, it lasts me the whole day if not more. The one thing I don’t like (I got the one without cellular) I need to have my phone with me to keep my AirPods connected and listening to music even when it shows up on my watch. Another thing I love though is that it motivates me to keep exercising and consistently doing enough to complete my rings keeps me active throughout the day.",4,97
Reloj inteligente táctil,"Un muy buen reloj puede competir sin problema con el garmin forruner 825, con el plus que es táctil",5,97
Great watch,"Wasn’t sure if I would like the watch because I thought it might be to big and uncomfortable. So glad I bought it, it’s not to big and bulky and it is very comfortable. I love that the watch motivates me to get up and move around, I can answer calls when my phone is charging. There are so many features on this watch I am still learning what I can do.",5,97
Great watches and good services,"Great watch, easy to setup and very easy to use, battery life is good, we all love it and recommended for everyone",5,97
It’s an Apple,"Bought the Apple Watch series 3 to replace my original series 1, as I cracked the screen. It’s an Apple hard to be disappointed!!",5,97
Daughter loves her watch,"0 problems so far, 4 months in use and daughter wears in daily.Seems to works almost flawlessly.",5,97
Blessed!!!!!,I got me a Apple Watch for my bday and I must say I’m soooooo in love with it. It keep track of basically your whole life. You don’t need your phone only if you FaceTime but other than that you good. I’m happy with my purchase and I will recommend it to friends and family,5,97
Would definitely recommend,Just as expected works great and the person it was for loves using it everyday no problems as of now,5,97
I love it! But get screen protector.,Still learning how to use it but I like it. Scratches easily so get the screen protector. I don’t like the bands that come with it though. They are more work out bands.,5,97
Bands fades and absorb color from clothes or other materials,"I bought this watch 4 moths ago and the bands got totally fades and turned green. i went to the apple store and the guys said that is totally normal because of the material but that is classify as normal wear and tear, so they recognized there is a problem but do not recognize that is a low quality product. What a shame on apple that they can not support its customers recognizing they have a low quality product that should be recalled.",1,97
Very Convenient,"I use my watch every single day. Most useful purchase I’ve ever made. It’s so convenient to just look at texts, emails, etc on my watch. I use the timer on it a lot when I’m working out as well. Over very helpful!",5,98
"Good, but not must have.","Apple Watch series 3 is my first smart watch, I’ve used it for two weeks now and well; it’s great in general.. but does it really changed my life as they says? Hmm, don’t think soIt’s good to have it but it doesn’t matter if I don’t.",4,98
Great watch!,Love it!!!!Biggest complaint to me is the battery life. I definitely have to charge it every night.,5,98
Battery life sucks,Apple Watch will not keep a charge any more feel like I got ripped off:( can not use it won’t even stay charged for a day !,1,98
apple watch,My daughter loves it!,5,98
"Good Apple Watch, glad it went on sale so I could get it","I love my Apple Watch it works perfectly and can pretty fast, watch works perfectly as I expected it to.",5,98
Not worth $200,Was expecting more from Apple. Maybe the newer versions are better. I honestly liked my old Fitbit Charge 2 better than this. It works like it should I’m sure. Just not as impressed as I thought I would be- maybe this watch is just outdated and I should have splurged and got the 4 or 5 but I don’t think they are THAT much different from the 3.,2,98
Love the watch for all the functions it has.,I like the visual screen and ease of chancing it.I also like being able to answers my iPhone XR through it.,5,98
Live my watch,"Love my watch.Only negatives is that the watch face will change without me changing it, and the swim tracker won’t count your distance unless you are actively using your arms",5,98
Couldn't pass up this price,Purchase for a Christmas gift.We'll see how he likes it.Look forward to the health tracking.,5,98
Work out connection,Great product!I bought this when the Polar Watch wouldn’t connect.This is easy to work and great for working out.,5,99
Item not registered as sold,"Bought item, watch would not pair, spoke with Amazon Rep, stated to speak to Apple. Apple tech could not pair, item labeled defective. Received replacement, same issue, finally took watch to Apple Store, tech there stated no evidence of either watch being sold so they couldn’t assist me in replacement. Contacted Amazon and got full refund. Was a difficult and painful experience. Beware!",1,99
Issues with Siri and Voice Settings,"Great watch but plan to send it back for a new one because it has not even been a full month and i am already having issue with the voice settings. When I try to talk to my watch to send a message while I am busy it no longer records what I said. Siri is not working either. I tried everything: restarting the watch, unpairing it from my phone then repairing it, looking up ways to fix it. Nothing has worked.",4,99
good purchase,Like the battery life and it also charges super fast. sleep tracking is complicated bc it doesn't really come with instructions and i have to download a third part app. can't wait for more apps to start using the watch since it's so convenient,5,99
Disappointed,"It worked perfectly for 2 weeks. Now the screen is unresponsive. I contacted Amazon and the only option I have is getting a refund and returning the watch. I really want another Apple Watch, but they are out of stock. So upsetting.",3,99
Great deal!,"Upgraded from a two to a three, love it! Purchased at a great price! Even received two years of Apple Care at a discounted rate! Awesome sauce!!",5,99
Great,Great,5,99
Great,The apple watches are just so damn cool. It fits perfect for a males wrist and is just awesome,5,99
Buy it.,"Love it. Moved from the first Apple watch to this one. Battery lasts all day, apps load quick.",5,99
Deal-lightful,Got it while it was on sale. Best in its class and at a great price. Recommended but wait until it’s on sale.,5,99
Deal-lightful,Got it while it was on sale. Best in its class and at a great price. Recommended but wait until it’s on sale.,5,100
Great watch,Love my Apple Watch.I love being able to keep track of how much calories I burn and I never miss a phone call with my watch notifications,5,100
Awesome choice for a friend or yourself!,Loved it so much I got one for my friend for their birthday. I love how it allows me to leave my phone more often.,5,100
Love my watch and the variety of bands you can wear the the watch.,"I like that the Apple Watch will send your notifications from the IPhone. I can’t always have my phone on me at work so when someone texts or calls I can answer or text them back from my watch. The watch does so much more, keeps track of your breathing, heart rate and let’s you know when you need to get up and move. Love it!",5,100
Great Watch,Product was delivered quickly I mostly use it for running works very well I’m happy with my purchase.,5,100
Great product,"Great ProductI was very skeptical in buying an Apple Watch let alone a series 3 from amazon, but I received my watch in brand new condition. Mine came in a certified Apple box, wrapped like it’s never ever been opened. Came with charger and an extra band. Did not come with wall outlet but that’s fine. This watch was worth the penny spent. I would recommend to anyone looking to purchase one for a reasonable price.",5,100
Apple Watch sucks.,Hoped for something that worked.Received it todayTook an hour to pair.Unable to change the band at this point. Too small. The release will not let go.Lots of money for crap.Keep looking.,1,100
Apple Watch,Just buy it on the special prime day! Got it at a great price. It came in a all close package. Same as picture! Love it!,5,100
9 out of 10 :),Pretty alright. Great watch and great for messaging. I bought it to keep track of how many miles I walk a day and I have an iPhone so it’ll be easier to pair. I really wish the Apple Watch had a wider range of apps to choose from and not just the basics. Best thing about the watch is that it is waterproof and that the banda come off.,4,100
My wife loves it!!,Presented this watch to my wife as a birthday gift. She was surprised when the watch reminded her that she has not started the daily workout yet. She loves it. Apple rocks!!!,5,100
Amazing watch for the price.,"It’s a great watch, does what it says. Doesn’t come with a “built it” sleep app and I’ve tried two that I’m not impressed with.",5,101
My wife loves it,My wife loves it,5,101
Doesn't work unless you have an iPhone 7 or higher,"Doesn't say on here that it is a paperweight unless you have an iPhone 7.I have an iPhone 6 and it won't do anything.Apparently that is on the apple website in the fine print, but don't see it here on the amazon site.Sucks.Mine has to go back because I'm not buying a new 500$ phone to make my 200$ watch work.Forced obsolescence should be illegal.",1,101
Very useful addition to my fitness monitoring,Very useful for tracking activity level. It needs to charge at night so it can’t monitor your sleep when it’s on the charger.,5,101
"Came as expected, battery life is less than ideal","I was a little leery to but an Apple Watch online, but it came in the Apple box and worked perfectly. The battery life is a little disappointing (lasts maybe a day and a half if you use it for tracking a workout and occasional text), but this is an earlier version.",5,101
Best thing I've bought,I don't know what I did before this watch lol..makes my life so much easier and keeps up with my sparatic heart rate,5,101
All worth it love it .<U+0001F60D>, Love my purchase anything came Sealed n new in the box . I was scared at first didn’t weather the buy or trust if it was new or refurbish so I took the chance n I was Satisfied . <U+0001F44D>,5,101
Never doubt an Apple product,Hesitated for about 2 days and finally pulled the trigger I mean first off the price is unbeatable when I got it I immediately opened it and there sat a beautiful space gray series 3 all watch! The setup was easy enough my 5 year old niece can setup. hasn’t even been 24 hours and I’m already inlove with this masterpiece! Don’t think about it just get it! Worth every penny!,5,101
Love this watch,"I really like this watch, the for is great and it works fine so for now I definitely recommend and the price was great for me <U+0001F44D>",5,101
Perfect,"I don’t sleep with mine on, but it performs well in other factions, I’m sure the sleep tracking is awesome as well.",5,101
Love it!,"It's a perfect choice for ppl who want to try wearable device. If you are not sure to use apple watch very useful so you are worried to spend money on it, watch 3 is the perfect option. Bc it's the cheapest in watch series now and not too bad to use it. Working very well for checking steps, fitness, notifying messages etc. If you use it well, then next purchase could be the latest version.",5,102
Get gen 4,Might as well been a reconditioned...... even after updating software still glitches in and out. Speaker sounds like an old blown radio shack speakerCouldn’t deal with it had to go to apple and get a gen 4,1,102
Charger did not work.,"The charger I was sent did not work. The watch itself worked but I had to pay $25 to order another Apple Watch charger separately from the defective one that was sent with my new watch. I would recommend paying the $200 to buy from Apple website instead of $170 here just to guarantee you are not getting a refurbished item, because obviously this charger had been returned by someone.",1,102
The screen has a pattern!!!,"I have to cut to leave a space for the button.The surface is not smooth, which makes the screen not clear. Very hard to read!",2,102
Good upgrade,"Very happy with this watch compared to the Fitbit versa that I had previously. The battery life is not great sadly and sleep tracking isn’t as well as the one on my Fitbit. It is very useful though, and a great upgrade!",4,102
What a great watch!,"I love it! I wasn’t gonna spend the money on a watch but it was so worth it. I have never spent $200 on anything like a watch. If you are an iPhone person, you will love having the watch. It has lots of settings to personalize it and it pairs to your phone.",5,102
Best purchase ever!,"I love it! Been using it everyday and helps keep me on track. It does calls, simple replies to texts, notifications and best adventure syncs with Pokémon go.",5,102
On time,Great product !,5,102
Buy it! So easy to setup and use.,"Love it. I debated on splurging on this, but I am so glad I did. Works straight out of the box and so easy to setup.",5,102
Defective battery.,I think the product is defective. My battery life does not last more than 1 hour. I use it twice at the gym which is a 45 mins workout and lasted the full session once and didn’t make it the second time. The watch have been fully charging.This product is a few days old. Issues like this should not be arising now.I don’t believe it was new.,1,102
A must.,My first ever Apple watch. Been wanting one for YEARS but never came around it. I saw it on sale and it was a no brainer. I finally bought one and it’s legit.,5,103
My watch did not come new as advertised.It still had the previous owners info on it.,"My watch did not come new as advertised by Amazon.It still had the previous owners info on it.Amazon directed me to Apple, who was great & tested to be sure it had no issues. It needed a software update though",2,103
Love it!,I’ve had an Apple Watch before and needed to replace mine since it was one of the first that came out. This is beautiful.Works great so far. The only issue I had was with Prime day and the website not allowing me to buy Apple care at the same time which is the ONLY time you can buy it. I’ll purchase from Apple directly.,5,103
Don’t buy it,"Received my watch and when I turned it on it kept asking me to reset the settings, like it was clear someone else had this watch before me... could not get it to work at all. Immediately sent it back..",1,103
WORK AMAZING,"Apple Watch Series 3 (GPS, 38mm) - Space Gray Aluminium Case with Black Sport Band. It has very good battery life and last for 24 hours in single charge. it works great on build in app and accurate. If you are iphone use you must try this watch.",5,103
Buy it!!!,Easy to purchase! Cheaper than on Apple website! Comes with everything you’d get in store!!,5,103
Works great,I absolutely love it! It's a great product for the price compared to the other watches.,5,103
Perfect gift for a young lady,Excellent Apple quality as always.. My daughter LOVES the watch. She works flawless and and synched up with her account perfectly.,5,103
Great buy! Especially on prime day!,"I’m not sure how it tracks my sleep but it works great, battery is awesome, and it’s great to track workouts and activity.",5,103
Kim Possible,My prior one broke I was so hurt. It couldn’t establish a Bluetooth connection and none of the tips online helped. If buying I definitely recommend getting apple care. I’ve missed my Apple Watch so much. I can feel like Kim Possible again lol,5,103
Works great!,Super nice watch. This may not be the newest Apple Watch but it still does everything I need it to do. Very nice and works great.,5,104
in love,"this watch is so handy, I absolutely love it. arrived within the time frame stated, and in perfect condition. so glad I finally took the plunge and bought it!!",5,104
Convenient notification checking,Bought this because unlocking my phone with a mask on is really annoying. Now I can quickly check my hundreds of notifications throughout the day directly on the watch,5,104
How did I live so long without an Apple Watch?,"I love this watch. I can wear it in the pool and get my texts, emails, and alerts where I don’t date bring my phone.The fitness app is great for keeping me on task daily and I even get a little reminder to stand up if I’ve been sitting too long.",5,104
"Great gift idea if you want to be the ""Best"" Pa Pa or Grandma in the world!","Can't tell you much about how it works. It was a gift for our granddaughter, but she wears it everyday since she got it and we are now the ""Best grandparents in the World"" lol. Can't go wrong with it.",5,104
Great,Was a bit skeptical at first but after having it for a while I am In love with my new watch. Comes with an extra band and a charger. Overall I am satisfied and would definitely recommend.,5,104
Perfect and brand new with new packing,"Brand new, perfect condition just like buying from store with plastic wrapping. Wife loves it! Don’t think about it, just buy it!",5,104
Seamless with an iphone and mac,Works perfectly and looks great. I was worried about the battery life but it can last ~3 days on a single charge depending how much I use it each day and it charges in under an hour! Definitely makes me more active because I want to close my circles!,5,104
Like,I like the watch and it's features. I got the bigger face watch. Wish it came with bands to switch. Came as described,4,104
Love my new watch :),This watch is soooo awsome I looove it. It’s also very handy and looks great with the case I got for it too thank you,5,104
Helpful and motivating,Best invention ever. I use my phone less now. It’s great because my phone can suck me into it most of the time. Keeps me off of it. It’s so helpful and motivating me to move!,5,105
Lov the watch,"Love the watch. Can answer calls and send texts on it. Have access to all my apps, but I really don’t use them. It reminds me to stand and move. Also it reminds me to take a minute to breathe which is good during my stressful workday.",5,105
Get it!!,I love this so far. I just got it and still learning. But I got it to track my heart rate and just keep me on track with health. So far it’s working great for what I wanted it for.,5,105
Great Buy and Brand New in Box!,Perfect! Couldn't ask for a better product.Paired on first attempt and works perfectly.,5,105
Great buy,"Bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas, great price, great gift! He loves it",5,105
Disappointed,I was super exited to get this watch but was a little disappointed. It doesn’t have great range- in terms of distance from my actual phone. I had connectivity issues. Siri was very slow.,3,105
Good price! Great watch,"Great watch! Gave it as a gift and it came with its charger, the 2 piece band, a replacement piece band, and instructions.I bought a soft cover case for it as I read the screen can be easily shattered and the replacement is expensive.I found this was a very good price for this “older” series which essentially does the same as the series 5 version.",5,105
Poor battery life,"After only 6 months the battery doesn’t last more than 8 hours even after turning off all notifications, background app refresh, etc. and repairing with my iPhone.",2,105
Good buy!!,Best Buy. I was debating on the Fitbit versa and versa 2 but decided tok go with the Apple Watch series 3 because I already have an iPhone do it just made sense to stay with Apple. Great product.,5,105
Convenient for texting/calling,Keeps accurate track of my activities and syncs with “My Fitness Pal” nicely.I enjoy the Siri feature and it’s positive reinforcement during my walks.,5,105
Dont Buy!,"Bought watch as new and doesn't work. Doesn't read my finer, doesn't scroll. Works when it wants too. Don't buy, better off going to apple store in person.",1,106
Life saver!,I’m very pleased with this Apple Watch! I was able to call for help from it the first day of wearing it when my power chair decided to dump me.I’m very glad I pick it over Fitbit and others.,5,106
I am a new believer,I was very curious about the Apple Watch . I had a garmin watch before and I loved it. But I am now glad I got the Apple Watch. It is very easy to set up and pair with an iPhone.,5,106
Best smart watch on the market!,"I love the watch. It tracks your BPM so when I just purchased my treadmill, it tracked my heart rate and how many calories burned throughout the workout. The series 3 is amazing!",5,106
Awesome product!,Original packaging,5,106
Great Apple iPhone Accessory,Great addition to the iPhone. The series 3 does almost all the 5 does for $179 on Amazon.,5,106
Truly amazing.,It’s amazing what this thing can do. I feel like I’m in Star Trek or something.,5,106
"Good gps tracking, wet screen = useless","I enjoy the gps tracking for long runs, the heart monitoring feature, and the fact that it can play music. If the screen gets wet, good luck trying to use it <U+0001F919><U+0001F3FC>",4,106
Poor quality,Battery life sucked on it and it would freeze up sadly . I think the item is broke when I received it,2,106
Works Amazing,"The apple watch is amazing. I never miss a notification and am always on top of my daily tasks. It's waterproof (don't forget to put it on water mode) so I can use it in the pool. The only downfall is that it only has about 18 hourd of battery life, which means I have to charge it overnight. Therefore, my sleep is not tracked. Overall though, I reccomend it.",5,106
Great!,"When the package arrives the watch is in the Apple box and comes with two different sized straps! Great battery life, could probably go two days without charging it. I have not tested water resistance yet but it is great for tracking workouts in the gym! So far no bad things to say! The only thing I would mention is that it says you're supposed to be able to command Siri to do things without saying ""Hey Siri"" but I haven't had any luck and I end up using the command.",5,107
Best Wearable device,if you want a wearable device for your iphone this is the best option and now affordable.pro - great way to communicate when your phone is away.cons- not the latest model with two more gen. released.,5,107
Upgrade,I upgraded after I lost my series 1 while cliff jumping. Basically the same features but it has much better battery life. My series 1 was silver and I decided to go for the darker look with this. Very happy with my purchase,5,107
Beautiful watch!,"Beautiful watch! I I love this Apple Watch series 3. I have no idea how I survived without it before. As a classroom teacher, this has helped me be more productive and efficient.",5,107
Great watch.,I love my watch. I wear it every day and use it for so many different things.Great purchase and good price.,5,107
Couldn’t ask for a better product.,"I was lost on finding one of my best friends a gift. I wanted to spend some money on her but didn’t want to get her something cheap. This is great for a gift. Not to expensive, not to cheap. It’s perfect. Great quality and overall a great product. <U+0001F60A>",5,107
Love it,Works perfect. Very easy to setup and this series seems to be amazing. Love it,5,107
This is overall a great product,The battery life is amazing the design is universal and versatile I don’t like that all the apps aren’t available on the watch,4,107
Arrived on time and just what we wanted,This apple watch is great.Arrived in a timely fashion and is a good price for this product!,5,107
Love it!,"Great, great watch! Everything works so fast and is so easy to use. I have really tiny wrists but I love the bigger watch face. If you’re not sure about tiny wrists with a big watch but are thinking about the 42mm, just buy it. Way more fun than the smaller one.",5,107
It need protection case,Bought two for each of my daughters. They both seem to like it so far. Didn't need my help to sync them so I think they are easy to use,5,108
It was perfect love it,I was spectacle to buy it from here because I usually buy all my stuff in a store but when I got it it’s was perfect it was sealed and when I open it it was good nothing wrong with it. Worked perfectly connected with my phone just fine it definitely change my mind. I love it.,5,108
TOTALLY WORTH IT,"I was debating on whether or not to g ahead and get one and I'm so happy I did! I'm 5'10"" 180lbs. The 38mm and the medium/large wrist band is perfect. I love this watch... for real... love it!",5,108
No regrets,"This was a great watch. I ended up selling it for $190. I’m glad I made this purchase, good seller.",5,108
Great fitness watch,I bought this watch as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It’s great for anyone trying to get in shape. Highly recommend,5,108
Amazing product!,I love the apple watch! Got another for my mom on her birthday and she LOVES it! Would recommend to anyone who is in need of a smart watch,5,108
Zero complaints,Exceptional in design and in price. The price point ($160) was too good to be true. Love how customizable the watch is and it fits so well. I have zero complaints. Buying one for my husband too!,5,108
Love,"Apple Watch 3 is amazing. Keeps great track of all your movements and sleep. Can talk and text from your phone while receiving texts and calls in a heartbeat. Only thing I wish is that the battery would last longer but other than that, I am so glad I made this purchasell",5,108
Pretty and durable!,"It’s very helpful and helps me track my fitness goals, daily! I got this one for my sister’s Birthday. I have been using the same Apple Watch for over 3 years.",5,108
Applewatch,After8 months this watch died. Very disappointing,1,108
Amazing watch!,"I Love the Apple Watch series 3! I’ve had it for 9 months now and it’s so good! I would recommend getting a case for it just to be safe. It’s so fast and easy to use I love it! I got at a great price too. I paid $169 before the Christmas season (late November) and it got here in a decent amount of time. What a great buy! And yes, it is a real Apple Watch.",5,109
Get it,Never thought I’d buy an Apple Watch but the price was right for the time and I got it and now I use it to track my activity and ensure I stay healthy,5,109
Wouldn't ever want to go back,It is a weird thought that this device would suddenly become such a part of one's daily life; it sort of has though. The most notable feature I have come to appreciate the most is the simple ability to get my notifications on my wrist. It may sound minor but this has made the experience of using my phone so much better.,5,109
Best ever,My fave Apple product. No need for newer versions. This one does everything. Great price,5,109
Good!,Got this as a gift for my wife and she says that so far she loves it! She hasn’t had a problem with it so far. So I will update as time goes on.,4,109
Good watch for the money.,"Great watch for the money.Since this is an older model it does not have all the new technology.But it does what you need it to.Everything works great!You can receive calls, text, get your emails and pretty much do everything you do on your smart phone if your phone is close to it.",5,109
Steal Deal,"So far, so good! Great deal, was gifted this item, it’s so convenient especially since I have a new born who HATES when I put my phone in my hand. I can reply to text through watch and it motivates me to get my steps in daily!",5,109
Love itttt,I love it it works so amazing and I’ve never had a problems with it,5,109
Love it!,I always said I would never get an Apple Watch but I finally did and I don’t regret it! Love it! Received it the very next day after ordering. Great price. It’s an older model but still is an awesome watch. Highly recommend!,5,109
Quick Delivery,Came quicker than expected. Works well and is in perfect condition!,5,109
Endless opportunities,"I absolutely love this watch! The amount of specs and opportunities are endless. Just when I think I've discovered everything about this watch, I find more. The GPS version allows you to call as long as your phone is within 33 ft, which was surprising because I wasn't sure if it allowed cellular abilities at all. This watch is perfect for athletic or busy individuals.",5,110
Yasss,"Loving it. Bought to help fitness tracking, but also loving the additional features!",5,110
This watch isn’t new.,I was under the impression this was a new watch and was very disappointed to see that the screen has scratches on it. The item description states nothing about this watch being refurbished.,2,110
Good design,It lacked the health features with the newer version. Should have gone with the iwatch 4.,2,110
Fun luxury,Feels like a luxury product and it keeps blowing my mind with what it can do with my phone,5,110
Not following the instructions of where to leave the package,The product was fine but they left it out in the open on top of a trash can when I let them know where to leave it. All they had to do was walk 50 more feet to hide it where I instructed them too. They left it in plain sight of the road.,5,110
Wife loves it,no need to buy the latest version...save some money and buy earlier version,5,110
The best!!,"Fantastic watch! I’m so glad it was on sale for Amazon Prime Day!! I haven’t stopped using it. Battery life is amazing, it accurately tracks both heart rate and sleep. I never want to take it off!",5,110
great watch,got for my wife and she loves it and works great for fitness trracking and app use.,4,110
Light weight,Brought it As a gift for my daughter who is a kindergarten teacher. she is unable to have her phone with her therefor this watch allows her an opportunity to keep in communication with family friends and what’s going on around her,5,110
Like it,Like this for the activity track and texting without having to grab the phone.,5,111
Awesome product,I brought this for my daughter and she loves it! She has ordered bands off Amazon to switch them out. Great product. Very easy to setup to her phone.,5,111
Wears it every day,My wife like her watch. It tracks her heart rate and counts her steps along with all the other apps options.,5,111
I feel the belt is smaller. Does the 42 size have bigger belt?,"I feel the watch tight on my wrist, even though I am wearing it on the last slot. I want to know if the 42 sizes just bigger on the dial or the belt is also bigger. Right now I am not enjoying it as it is sticking to my wrist.I am not able to make calls through FB messenger and cannot find WhatsApp in the watch.",3,111
Great product.,I love this watch!!! It has met or exceeded all of my expectations. The best part for me is that I wore it to the beach and in the ocean.I’m pretty picky and hate spending money lol but I’m so glad I got this. :) I’m also glad I bought the apple care! It’s scratched already (my fault!) and I can get a whole new watch for $35.,5,111
Not happy!!!!,I bought this a month ago and it already doesn’t charge. It’s literally been in use a month today!!! WTF. NO RETURN option shows so calling tech support it is. Ugh. I’m already over this.,1,111
Perfect,"Love this watch, I have been debating for a long time about getting a smart watch. I love how this is connected to my iPhone and all the apps it has on it! So happy with my purchase!",5,111
"Brand New, not Renewed","This was supposed to be a refurbished product, but what I received appears to be brand new. I could not be more pleased.",5,111
Love my watch,This is my second apple watch. Don't know how I could function without it!,5,111
Amazing!,"Absolutely love this product. The battery lasts for days and it’s perfect for my busy life. I can read texts messages, track my heart rate, and much more. The white band gets dirty pretty quickly, but it’s easy to clean with a cloth",5,111
Love my Apple Watch.Best replacement for my Fitbit,"It’s Apple.It’s perfect.Track’s workouts.Shows progress.And oh so much more.Price was great.Never going back to Fitbit (sorry my old Fitbit... you lived a long time, but like the xerox 860, it’s time to go).",5,112
Love it!,Been wanting one for a while now and decided to get one since I’ve been so lazy during quarantine... this is saving me! I’m way more motivated to get up and start working out and keep going all day!,5,112
Not as good as the ionic for health tracking,"Preferred the Fitbit ionic for health tracking. This is a better casual watch and feels better built, but I will go back to Fitbit for my next watch",3,112
Great purchase,Love my watch! As described. Very pleased with my purchase. Better than purchasing at Apple. Price was awesome.,5,112
Steal deal,Great bday gift for my 14 year old son. He loves it. Easy to use and set up.,4,112
Awesome,"I love having this watch, I always get all my messages and calls right on my wrist, now I can do dishes, laundry etc... and not worry about missing out on anything important. Also love the heart rate tracker.",5,112
Perfect new,Just what I was expecting it’s like new!!! No signs of been used before!! And came faster!! It’s supposed to be here by Friday and today is Tuesday!!,5,112
Didn’t last a year,"Nice while it lasted. I work from home, so I bought this to help keep track of my activities and sync with the Life App. I’ve had it for 8 months. I’d say normal use, and the watch face has already come off and away from the body of the device. I live abroad, so taking it to an authorized Apple dealer for repair requires a flight. Very annoying.",2,112
I like it,I like this watch. It works well and was a good price. It doesn’t hold a charge for very long but I guess that’s kind of the Apple Watch downfall.,5,112
Love it!,My daughter loves her Apple watch! We got it FAST after ordering! Packaged very nice! Works AWESOME!,5,112
Best Christmas Gift,"My daughter loves her watch, as an athlete it is amazing what all this watch can do!",5,113
Very happy with this purchase.,"Just as expected. Great price too. You do not get a charging block as other reviewers mention and that is an error in the description. I found out that Apple only sells it with the magnetic cord anyway (at least this particular version), and we did get that. Very happy with this purchase.",5,113
Bad battery; great watch,Battery life was kind of disappointing. I figured it might be better than galaxy watches but it is actually worse.Overall impressed though.Would love to see a 3 day battery,5,113
Pretty content,"Mostly wanted a smart watch that could track my workouts and change music on my iPhone. Pretty happy with buying the Series 3. I like that I can walk around my place without having to carry my phone around. Only bummer is battery life, always charging it at the end of the night.",5,113
Watch misses notifications mirroring iPhone XR. Never had issue on series 2.,This watch misses notifications. I never had that issue with the series 2.,3,113
Buy refurb,Love my apple! This one is way cheaper and a good watch comes like new!,5,113
Apple Care available !!! Less expensive than refurbished models.,Less expensive than refurbished models!!!! You can get apple care.Great product.,5,113
I really enjoy watching my workout progress from my watch.,I definitely like the size of the watch and band. I use this mostly for my workouts,4,113
Love it,"Love all the exercise features, fits comfortably and works as a Apple Watch should",5,113
Amazing product,This Apple Watch really changes how you live your daily life. It’s very convenient to have to send a quick text or to check out your heart rate! I love how you can download a bunch of apps that are compatible with the watch itself. Highly recommend getting this for anybody! :),5,113
Love it great deal works awesome,Love it super good deal on price will be buying again can’t believe the price wow,5,114
too big,The fit of the case was off and didn't fit as I wanted it to.I had to buy another one.,1,114
Best purchase I’ve ever made !,I absolutely love my Apple Watch and have recently bought one for 3 others in my family! Keeps you on your toes by staying active and is a fun way to connect with others fitness goals.,5,114
Great!,Great at tracking heart rate and just as expected! The band is very comfortable.,5,114
My watch rocks,"Love talking in my watch, never missing a call or knowing every time I get a txt and not lugging around my phone",5,114
the watch does not do much,my first apple watch its good but there is not much itcan do sometimes it doesnt even alert me that i got a message,5,114
So helpful!,"Love it!! Perfect size, great features and major help staying organized and on schedule (especially as a teacher).",5,114
I LOVE MY WATCH!!,What Can I Say....Like all my other Apple products it is PERFECT....'nuff said.,5,114
Glitchy,It glitches a lot and keeps disconnecting from my iPhone. I ended up giving it to my sister.,1,114
Does not pair with iphone 5s,"No matter what other people say, even on this product page, this will not pair with an iphone 5s",1,114
it's good for guys love exercise,"i can run without my phone. this is the most important feature for me.it can work as long as two days for me, but it's not very long as well.",4,115
Christmas present bust! Can’t activate because it is locked from previous user.,I can not even activate my watch due to an activation lock from the previous owner. My child got this as a Christmas present and was so excited till we realized it won’t work with her Apple ID.,1,115
Don’t waste your money,"Watch got delivered December 31st,2019...a couple weeks later the watch wouldn’t stay connected to my phone. I wouldn’t get any notifications from it.",1,115
Great Product,Love my Apple Watch bought it mostly for workout purposes and tracking it came on time and I’m having fun making little slide show watch faces!,5,115
In package sealed brand new,Sealed box. Sent back as it was a gift for spouse and he didn’t want.,5,115
Apple everything rocks,Love it. Got 3 total and my two boys love their watches and son gf loves her.,5,115
Doesn't actually let you use the full 8GB thats stated to be.,Didn't like it because of the storage issue.I bought it to use for music on the go when I'm at the gym.It didn't allow me to add more than about 2-4gb of songs.When I contacted apple support they didn't know why it wouldn't let me use more.They told maybe this isn't the product for me so I returned it.,3,115
Buying a second one for my husband,Fantastic watch am buyingthis same model for my husband so hell stop asking if he can wear mine,5,115
Amazing Battery life,"I love the AppleWatch 3 , it’s very similar to the 1 generation but the battery life is fairly better. I charge it every night so I’m not sure about the sleep tracker but I waited to write this review to know how well the battery life was! I highly recommend this for the price !",5,115
Waste of money,"Very overrated. This thing works about as well as a 30$ Fitbit. Only works correctly sometimes, when it even actually works that is.",2,115
ITS WORTH IT,I just received mine yesterday and I’m in love! So much cheaper than buying from Apple and it works perfectly fine! I think it’s worth buying <U+0001F600>,5,116
Niceeeeee,"Genial mi encanta, es mi primer Apple Watch! Esta completamente nuevo",5,116
"Heart rate, breathing app, great device",Great device,5,116
Great Deal,Brand new in box. Guarantee starts as soon as you set up watch. Recommend it,5,116
Great price from Amazon.,I bought this watch primarily to track swim laps. Works better than devices that are dedicated to swimming because of the varity of apps available. G,5,116
Love the activity tracker functions,This watch and all it's functions are incredibly easy to use. I would recommend getting a screen/face protector.,5,116
Do not buy,Ordered this item TWICE and both times watch could not be paired to phone. Do not buy this product. Total waste of time. Took it to an actual Apple store and Apple did not recognize it as being sold therefore it would never be able to pair with your phone. Returning was easy but wasted so much time. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!,1,116
best purchase,my wife love it,5,116
Keeps me on track,"It keeps me moving and I like that.Battery life is amazing, I dont even have to charge it everyday.",5,116
"Real Product, Original packaging","It worked good for the first few weeks I got it then it stopped charging all of a sudden. It came in the original packaging. I called Apple and since it’s still new I have a warranty and they would replace the battery for free. I do not suggest using it around water or in the shower with steam as that can mess up software ,although it says it waterproof I would not take any chances.",3,116

Love it,"Great buy, cake in a timely manner. The screen does scratch easy so definitely get screen protector. The battery last about two days on average",5,117
Never buy from the actual Apple store,"Great great and more great, don’t buy it from the official Apple store. If you buy all your Apple needs from Apple through amazon you’ll save money and still get great condition. I love this watch",5,117
Perfect watch for my wifes needs,"My wife loved it, this is a great product and price for her needs",5,117
Good watch good value,Best watch for an Apple phone. Only watch that fully works with an iPhone.,5,117
I would buy this again!,"I didn’t rate the sleep tracking because I don’t use that, I’m trying to avoid excess EMFs. I put off buying this for a long time but now wish I’d gotten one sooner. No regrets! This helps me to focus on my health and fitness, love it!",5,117
Don’t waste your money,Don’t waste your money buy a new watchWouldn’t pair with my phone POC <U+0001F44E>box said it was3 watch &was a 2 charged me for a 3 ridiculous returned itthree ago Still don’t havemy refund what’s up with that ?,2,117
Apple watch series 3,Thanks alot now my iPhone has a watch to it as well and it really works great with it,5,117
I love my series 3 Apple Watch.,"I’m glad that I did not spend the extra money on the series 4, The series 3 does everything that I am looking for.",5,117
42 mm,"Husband loved it, and it’s big enough for his tired eyes to see!",5,117
Very nice and convenient,"I mostly use mine to track my heart rate, however, it’s proved to be quite convenient when I’m busy and get a text or phone call or when I lose my phone. It’s especially useful for telling you when you need to exercise/for how long. Would definitely recommend.",5,118
Improved battery life,I only need to charge the battery about every 3rd day. Much improvement from series 1.,5,118
Worthless not working,"It’s linked to Apple ID and password. You can’t connect it to your phone. Don’t buy it, it’s worthless and wasting money.",1,118
Simplify Life!,"I love just about everything about this watch! The only downsides I can come up with are that Siri doesn't always work, and I can't manually edit an incorrect talk to text word.",5,118
Great watch,"Good price, always wish apple products were a little cheaper but overall love this watch.",5,118
Apple watch,Got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. No need to buy the more expensive one.,5,118
not perfect,this one the battery life is not good and the speed is really slow,4,118
Warning: won’t last 6 months,Bought in May. The watch face cracked. Now the battery doesn’t charge. Supposedly new watch but I assume it must be a fake.Don’t buy this.,1,118
A lot of watch.,The Apple Watch simply wasn’t for me. I went back to my Fitbit as it’s easier and more user friendly.,2,118
It’s ok.. for the price it should be in perfect condition.,Screen doesn’t always respond. I can never clear all my apps from the dock screen and the “talk” to text feature is a joke and never picks up what I’m saying.,3,118

Great watch,Great watch I did get the protection case this time around lol,5,119
Great,"The watch was brand new and in great condition. It come in the original apple box unopened and has everything included; extra band, and charger. The battery life is great I charge it every night however when I put it on the charger at night the watch is still at like 67-60% so I don’t really need to charge it I just choose to.",5,119
Tap to say the time,"Bought it for my wife. She loved it. Wish there was a custom watch face with the analog hands. They have the stock faces, which she likes very much.",5,119
For my wife,Easy to use text phone callsyou can do everythingbattery life is 2day,5,119
Legit Apple Watch <U+0001F60C><U+0001F525>,Love this watch and what it does with iphone...I’ve Been trying to get an Apple Watch ever since and now I finally got one at a discounted price I could afford....Buy it while you can...the hype is all there,5,119

Great value,"Arrived in perfect condition, such a great new accessory. Battery life isn’t so great but it’s to be expected from apple products. I’ve been team iPhone for years and that’s my only gripe. It does however charge quickly. So other than that, this was a great buy. So many convenient apps and different ways to respond to a msg makes my life so much easier. Set up is a breeze too.",5,119
Very nice,This was a present for my wife it works great and she loves it,5,119
Best watch ever!,My second Apple watch and I love it! Does everything I want.,5,120
"Awesome watch, great battery life.","I knew of most of the features that would come with an Apple Watch, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how many features there actually are.Also, the battery life on this watch is much better than what I had heard/expected. It was easily last me 2 days with regular usage.That being said, I would absolutely(and I actually have) recommend this watch to a friend or family member. 5/5",5,120
Love this watch.,It is a huge step up from the Apple Watch 1.,5,120
All the features.,Love it !! Packed with so many great features. Wish I had gotten one sooner.Batter life needs improvement.,5,120
Perfect,Love my new watch!,5,120
Exactly what I expected!!,"The watch is perfect! New in box, works great, and is super comfy to wear! When you find items at a price far below anywhere else, it can make you skeptical. But this is exactly what it says it is- Brand New Apple Watch 3, for a great price!",5,120
Perfect workout buddy to keep you motivated,Love this watch! Keeps me motivated to meet my exercise goals everyday. The only downside is there battery life,5,120
Do not hesitate ordering this watch!,This watch is fantastic! There are so many apps and features to choose from. Well worth the money!,5,120
Love it!,Great Apple Watch for the price. It has a the features I needed without the latest Apple Watch prices. I wish the battery would stay charged longer and wish Amazon music worked ok it but overall I’m happy with it.,5,120
Anyone can figure it out,"As always Apple comes thru. Easy to sync, easy to use. The person I bought it for doesn’t read instructions yet she has it working perfectly. Amazingly the thing even knows which swimming stroke she used. Pricey but it works well and I don’t have to figure it out and explain some complex thing.",5,120
"Works, fits, and looks great!!","Purchased for my husband!! Works, looks, and fits great!! He loves it!!",5,121
Impressed!,It still works after a year and I’ve put it through hell so I’ll give it a 5 star,5,121
Amazing watch!,Such a great purchase! I’m very happy with this item. Works great and is very helpful with everyday life and my work <U+0001F49A>,5,121
Didn't fill my needs well as a watch.,"This is probably perfect for fitness involved folks, but not for me.",3,121
We just love the Apple Watch!,I use many features of this watch many times a day. Can’t imagine not having it.,5,121
Great wrist companion,"Me and my girlfriend both have Apple watches and we completely love them. I use my watch everyday, but I find it to be the most useful when I'm working. I'm able to keep track of time and notifications easily through this device. If you're on the fence about getting one of these, you should definitely buy one if you have the means.",5,121
Keep connected,"Getting old enough that I struggle to hear phone and text alerts, I haven’t missed a call since strapping on this wonder! All the information it gives me; weather, news alerts, physical activity...are added bonuses.",5,121
Great buy!!,It’s my first Apple Watch so it was a great buy for the price. I use it mainly for exercise. And it monitors my sleep and heart rate. The only thing is the battery life. Have to charge it every 1-2 days.,5,121
It's awesome,"I really don't think any review isrequired for apple product as every one knows the Apple productquality and service hmmm...Only one word this watch is ""Awesome""",5,121
Keeps me active,"I’m a very competitive person so seeing my friends activity motivates me to get a workout or 2 in! And reminds me to have active rest days like a nice walk or yoga, just MOVE! Love it 10/10.",5,121
Doesn’t hold charge,Battery dies very fast even when not in use. Wanted to love it but I am very disappointed.,3,122
Absolutely worth it!!!,"From day 1 I AM OBSESSED. Wore it to the gym tonight and absolutely loved all the features it has for tracking fitness progress, heart rate, etc. I’m not even a huge calorie counter but I now understand why every Apple Watch owner says it has changed their life. It’s so aesthetically pleasing too<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FB> I have a tiny wrist so 42mm is a tiny bit big on me but I love it in every way. It was delivered on time and in perfect condition.",5,122
battery doesnt last 4 hours,Had for about 8 months and battery doesn't even last more than 4 hours.,1,122
It's not scratch resistant.,"It feels great to have such a technological device right on your wrist. Nice watch and everything but within 24 hours of acquiring it, I scratch it. How? I don't really know, I'm assuming by simply going on about my normal life. It's annoying having this massive scratch across the screen on this newly bought device. I believe the 4 and 5 series have the same issue.",2,122
Great watch,Other than needing to delete every text message off of the watch individually... works great,4,122
Great deal!,These are still great for the money!I bought it for my wife. She loves it.I have a series 4 and this is just as good.,5,122
Worth the monet,Great watch. Suits all my needs and looks good too.,5,122

Definitely recommend!!!,Great product! I’ve always wanted an Apple Watch and I’m so happy with it. My mother in law (who is like my best friend) has one and we use the walkie talkie option to communicate across the house.Great for hands free talk-text and other little features. Even can have maps open on my watch.,5,122
Battery,I enjoy all except the need to charge just about every day,4,123
Love,"If I needed to buy this again would totally come back. This is most definitely a real apple watch, for those out their hesitant to buy it. It comes in the apple box and immediately connected to my phone when I powered it on.Definite steal, happy I bought it.",5,123
Love the I watch,I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she loves this watch I need to get me one now,5,123
Money well spent,"I didn’t ever really get the point of these watches, but they are so useful! It’s nice to get notifications while away from my phone, and it’s nice to see how active I actually am.",5,123
Apple Watch S3 42mm Black review,Ordered the product this morning at 9:35am. Received it by 6:45pm. I chose the one day amazon prime option. Arrived on time to a T!!!!!!! Works flawlessly. AMAZING price. I was worried the 42mm would be too big for my wrists but it fits comfortably and perfect. Thank you amazon for this deal! Would recommend.,5,123
Great,"Very good watch and very durable, definitely has the capacity of the w3 chip iniside and it is water resistance as well as fast when it comes to paring up to your iOS device, good quality aluminum, and a super finished fine plastic for the sport black band",5,123
"For the one star ratings, PAIRING FAILED","Had the same pairing issue like many of the one star ratings, while paring withan XS.Had to upload program, didn’t work with the XS. Paired then with an old 6S, loading up the program worked fine, unpaired, paired with the XS, workes perfect now....Maybe luck, but worked it for me",5,123
Great overall,"Came packages well, set up was easy, looks nice no scratches, only compliant which might be an Apple Watch thing is it disconnects from my phone easily.",5,123
Get it !,"I was skeptical to get an Apple Watch online but honestly it’s the best I would of regret not getting it ! It’s real , works great",5,123
Swimproof,It was really good up until a couple weeks ago. I purchased it and received it in around the fall time. 2 weeks ago I went to the beach and kept it off in the water. Until one day I thought that it was water resistant for 50 meters! I went in the water which was not more then a meter and a half and boom it stopped working. I even had the water mode turned on.,3,123
Love it!,I love it! Makes it so much easier to see text messages while at work. I work at a restaurant and can’t always take my phone out. This is great I can text at work again!,5,124

I love this watch,I love this watch. I’m learning something new about this watch everyday. I also love the different band options.,5,124
Love Apple phone but do not like Apple watch,I thought like the steps walked on a phone the watch would be the same. It is disappointing not to see easily how many steps I have taken.Heart rate is also important for my health that is ok not what I was expecting either.If I had to try it and rate it I would not purchase it because I found the watch not doing for me what I need.,4,124

New phone who dis,"Really nice, comes in hand especially when you lose your phone in your house all the time.",5,125
Is it a watch or a lifestyle?,Working well. I need to update myself to get the full benefit. I like the exercise tracking. As for the watch itself working well.,5,125
As advertised,It is serie 3 As advertised works perfect with the iPhone 11 promax I may give it away as a gift and by the current version and sound because I want to monitor my health and the newest version has a lot of features that does that but this is definitely a good watch shipping was super fast earlier than expected,5,125
Didn’t last,"Broke in less than a year. Had a screen protector on it. Somehow the face cracked where it connected to the base, never hit it in anything or dropped it.",1,125

So happy I finally did it,Ive been wanted an apple watch for a while and I am so happy I finally splurged.I love the activity rings and be able to quickly review notifications.The sleep tracking is fun but it does eat up battery pretty good.The watch does charge relatively fast but I typically charge it every other night.Very happy with this purchase!,5,127

"Decent smart watch,however best in its breed.","Apple Watch provides great UX compared to Fitbit, however, comparing these two I still love how FitBit holds charge for 4 days while the Apple Watch looses its juice just in 30 hours.I also still miss the sleep tracking functions.In all other aspects Apple beats any other watch I previously had.

A gift,Bought one for my daughter for her birthday after buying myself one. She loves it and loves the sleep tracking.,5,136
A must have!,An overall great purchase! Use it all the time!,5,137
Apple of my eye!,I’m not really a watch person at all and never thought I would like it but I decided to give in and purchase one and I’m glad I did!!! There is so many features on this watch from apps for music to health. I would definitely recommend this watch!,5,137
Worth it!,Affordable vs. the newer models. I love it and use it everyday to track my intake and the calories I burn.,5,137
The wrist band gets dirty,"Too difficult to tell on a photo, but the wrist band discolors lightly after 1 week so I'm forced to take 1 star off. I guess it could be normal, but still not very satisfactory given the premium price. I love apple products but where's the next Steve Jobs?",4,137
Apple Watch Series 3,My daughter absolutely loved the Apple Watch Series 3!!!,5,137
Great,Love this!!!! Have not used the sleep function. The battery last about a day and a half for me,5,137

Love my watch!,What else can I say other than it’s amazing? Apple products never disappoint!,5,137
Apple Watch,"Brought it for my 20yr daughter last year. Christmas coming up this year and she’s still talking about how this was her best gift.Now that’s comparing to uggs, lab top, coats etc.",5,138
Great Purchase,"Really long battery life and chargers very fast! The band is very comfortable, and comes with two bands for different sized wrists. Comfortable to sleep in, but needs loosened in the middle of the night. It really enhances everyday life and cuts down looking at a phone for everything!",5,138
Cool watch,Awesome watch for the price which was on sale on Prime Day.,5,138
Very good purchase!,I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! He uses it every day and hasn't run into any problems at all. I might get one for myself as well!,5,138

Love,I don’t know what I was waiting on this watch is great. Fast shipping and easy to set up,5,139

Gifts for the girls!,These were gifts for my granddaughters and they love them !,4,139

Like the watch but battery life sucks,It needs to be charged everyday. I am returning it.,2,140
Nice Apple Watch!,"Great buy! It works very nice, I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I love it. Only thing you should buy a case for it because it’s really easy to scratch it. Specially if you’re gonna use for work, like me.",5,140
great watch!,i love this watch i wear every day and have had it for over a year. it works great but you need to buy the screen protector separately other wise the screen will scratch and maybe crack. and the battery life works for the full day never had it die on me.,5,140
Pleasantly Surprised....,I'm pleasantly surprised that I really like this watch. I feel like it's definitely worth the money. I don't need all the functions of the brand name watches. Mainly I use the steps and sleep counting.,5,140
Worth every penny!,I LOVE my Apple Watch. Well worth the small investment. Love the reminders to get my booty moving and really love that it is waterproof.,5,140
Perfect.,"I bought it to help monitor my heart rate, does a great job. The battery life is also amazing.",5,140
Great runner watch,"Bought it as a present. Seems the best option as a simple runner watch for iOS user. Has GPS, offline music, navigation. No need to hold tone of equipment and wires while runningDecided to choose 3rd generation for it's price point and not so huge difference with the 4th one",5,140
Great for so many things!!,"Love the activity tracker and the reminder to move around when I’ve been sitting at my desk too long, also great for answering calls when I’m working on something and need my hands!",5,141
Love it!,"I had a Fit Bit Charge 2 for over 2 years and figured it was time for an upgrade. There aren't many differences between the Series 3 and 4. I couldn't pass up the sale price! Highly recommend! I have a smaller wrist, so the 38MM was perfect for me!",5,141

Works well so far,Haven't had any issues. Storage is a bit low but if you don't keep too many apps on the watch it should be fine. Screen is bright enough for outdoor use. Battery lasts a full day.

Good product for price,Brand new works well so far,5,196
True Apple product,"This is great! Legitimate Apple product at a great discount! I’ve had no problems and it was a great replacement for my dying series 1. The screen is a little smaller than I expected, so I wish I had gotten the 40 instead of 38 but other than that no complaints!",5,196
Terrible customer services,3 days after receiving the watch the microphone quit working. After taking it to apple support they told me to try amazon warranty. Called the amazon or seller from the amazon app and got a run around. Then abruptly transferred to apple. Worst customer service from an amazon seller ever.,2,196
LOVE IT,Love it def worth 200 bucks. Only thing is if you work outside and in the dirt buy the black band not the white it gets dirty. You can wash it with water so no big deal but over time it starts to stay kinda dirt color but other then that love it.,5,196
love it!,Got it for my dad and he loves it.,5,196
Much better than my original first issued Apple Watch,"Great sound, great everything. Worth the purcahase.",5,196
Love it!!!,I absolutely love this watch. The colors on the screensaver are vibrant. Worth every penny.,5,197
La calidad,Solo una sugerencia: La próxima vez los paquetes deberían dejarse en la puerta del apartamento para evitar robos o malas experiencias. Me gusta mucho comprar por Amazon pero no me gusta para nada que mis paquetes queden en lugares inseguros. Me gustaron mucho los artículos.,5,197
"Be sure to check the box thoroughly before throwing away, I almost threw out my charger","Very convenient and a decent priced. I can’t have my phone on the floor at work so this helps.

Was already paired to another Apple account,"Upon receiving the watch, I opened the package and charged the watch. When trying to connect the device to my IPhone 7plus it did not work.

Great,Great new addition to my exercise tracking,5,197
Loveeee,"I was hesitant to purchase an Apple Watch because I’ve always been a fan of traditional time pieces. However, I LOVE it. The heart rate and breathing app have helped with controlling my anxiety, and it makes functionality at work so much faster!",4,197

Very nice!,Exactly what I ordered. Very pleased with my new iwatch.,5,198
Disappointing,"2 months after purchase, husband was wearing watch when the face exploded off the watch while on his wrist in the kitchen. Apple will not replace or repair watch.Total loss of my $300+ amazon purchase. I am totally disappointed",1,198
can't go wrong,an apple watch at the best price. bought it direct from amazon,5,198
Worth so much more than the Price!,"Super product for the price, a lil low on the battery life.",5,198
Beyond Fragile & Annoyed,First Apple Watch (purchased from Apple in person) lasted me 18 months before the screen shattered.This amazon purchased Apple Watch lasted me exactly 2 months and the screen is shattered. So much for that purchase. FAIL,1,198
Best smart watch for your money,I really like this watch. I’ve wore it for several months with great success. I purchased it to help me keep track of steps and activity but now that I have it I really enjoy being able to read and answer text messages and change songs from my watch!,5,198

Very satisfied,"Very happy with this product, it did take along time to receive it. But worth the wait",5,199

Haven’t had long enough,Haven’t had long enough,4,200
Great product for price point,The watch is very nice and I personally love it. I also found that as long as your phone is with you while you wear the watch all calls and messages will be received through the watch so I’m my case I did not need the cellular add on.,5,200
Worth It,Got it from Amazon directly for $229. Such an amazing useful device well worth the price!,5,200

Wrong item,"I received my item and as I’m opening it, the box was somewhat broken and when I opened it, it wasn’t even an Apple Watch. There was a normal watch in there with no charger or anything at all, very disappointed in this and will be getting my money back.",1,205
No Charger,I originally bought this for myself and loved it. I bought it again for my dad for Father’s Day. Unfortunately it didn’t come with a charger like mine did. Very disappointing since he now can’t use his Father’s Day gift and has to wait for a charger to come in the mail.,4,205
It' like having a phone on your wrist!,"Love it, product came in the original packaging, unopened with all of the accessories. It was quick and easy to set up.

Get this if you’re debating between a series 5!!,Bad a** man!!Was debating between this series 3 or the series 5. I have relatively small wrists so this size fits nicely and looks cleaan.

Meets expectations,Came as described and within the expected delivery period. Very pleased!,5,224

Screen crackes too easily,"Bought the Series 3 in April and by July screen cracked. Called apple and their warranty wont cover screens. The cost to repair quote given was $279.00 plus 7.00 for shipping. My purchase price of the watch itself cost less than the repair. Waist of money, should have bought a Fitbit or Garmin instead.",1,228

False advertising,I ordered and paid for Series 3 42mm Apple Watch and received 38mm instead. The original box had 38mm up there but there was a sticky label that stated it was a 42mm. However on the back of watch it is definitely 38mm,1,238

DO NOT GET IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE 6,I bought this watch and excitedly waited a week for it to come in brand new. I finally get it and it won’t pair because my iPhone is out of date. Apparently if the watch is updated to watch O.S. 6 you can’t pair it with an iPhone 6 because the iPhone 6 doesn’t update past 12. Really stupid.,1,239
very sleak,my wife loves it,5,239

information on watch use is not very good.,"Calling for help if I fall.the paperwork that came with the watch was very hard to read, small grey print on white.",2,307
